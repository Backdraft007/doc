Brick Viewer (brickv)
=====================

.. note::
 Diese Seite wird in k체rze auch vollst채ndig in Deutsch verf체gbar sein.

Der Brick Viewer bietet eine graphische Oberfl채che um
:ref:`Bricks <product_overview_bricks>` und
:ref:`Bricklets <product_overview_bricklets>` zu testen. Each device has its own
view that shows the main features and allows to control them.

Additionally brickv can be used to calibrate the analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) of the Bricks to improve measurement quality
(see :ref:`here <brickv_adc_calibration>`)
and to flash bricklet plugins (see :ref:`here <brickv_flash_plugin>`).

In Ubuntu you can also use the Ubuntu Software Center, other Desktop
environments have very similar tools that practically work the same way.
You can start the Brick Viewer in the application menu under electronic
or in the console with::

 brickv

To install Brick Viewer from the console use the following::

 sudo apt-get install python python-qt4 python-qt4-gl python-qwt5-qt4 python-opengl python-serial
 sudo dpkg -i brickv_linux_latest.deb

To install Brick Viewer from source, download the source from
`here <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/brickv>`__ and install the dependencies:

* python-qt4
* python-qt4-gl
* python-qwt5-qt4
* python-opengl
* python-serial

On Debian based distributions you can do that as shown above, on other
distribution you have to search for and install the equivalent packages.

To start brickv from source, change to the folder
brickv/src/brickv/ and start with::

 python main.py

.. note::
 Unfortunately Debian has at the time of writing this tutorial problems with
 the python-qwt5-qt4 in Wheezy. If you use Debian Wheezy and you can't
 find python-qwt5-qt4 in the repository, you have to install it from Sid::

  echo 'APT::Default-Release "testing";' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf
  edit /etc/apt/sources.list, copy your non-security testing lines and change one set to sid
  apt-get update
  apt-get -t sid install python-qwt5-qt4


Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

To install the Brick Viewer on Mac OS X, download the
.dmg form :ref:`here <downloads_tools>`.
Click on the downloaded file, this should open the package:

.. image:: /Images/Screenshots/brickv_macos_1_small.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Brickv installation step 1
   :align: center
   :target: ../_images/Screenshots/brickv_macos_1.jpg

To install the Brick Viewer drag and drop the file to your applications folder

.. image:: /Images/Screenshots/brickv_macos_2_small.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Brickv installation step 2
   :align: center
   :target: ../_images/Screenshots/brickv_macos_2.jpg

After this you have finished the installation process.
Please restart your machine after this (otherwise the icons don't show up for
some unexplained reason).


Usage
-----

To use the Brick Viewer you have to first start the
:ref:`Brick Daemon <brickd>` either on the same PC or on a PC in the same
network. Enter the IP (localhost if you started the Brick Daemon on the
same PC). Press "connect". Now you can go through the tabs at the top
and test your Bricks and Bricklets.

   :align: center
   :target: ../_images/Screenshots/brickv_setup_tab.jpg

If you click on "Flashing" you can flash firmwares and plugins onto Bricks and
Bricklets. If you click on "Advanced Functions" you can calibrate the ADCs of
Bricks (see below).


.. _brickv_adc_calibration:

Brick ADC Calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have problems with inaccurate measurements (e.g. Linear Poti does not
reach the maximum or the voltage measurements in a stack are slightly off)
it is possible that the calibration of the ADC is to blame.

To measure analog values, the microcontrollers
on the Bricks have analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It is never guaranteed
that an ADC on a microcontroller is perfectly calibrated. To overcome
this problem, we make it possible to calibrate the ADC in your Bricks.

For the calibration you need one of the potentiometer Bricklets (Rotary Poti
or Linear Poti). Connect it to a Brick and click on "Advanced Functions" in
the Setup tab of Brick Viewer:

.. image:: /Images/Screenshots/brickv_advanced_functions_calibrate_small.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Brickv (ADC Calibration)
   :align: center
   :target: ../_images/Screenshots/brickv_advanced_functions_calibrate.jpg

Choose the port your poti is connected to (A-D).
Turn your poti completely to the left and press "Calibrate", then turn
your poti completely to right and press "Calibrate" again. If your ADC
wasn't calibrated well the gain and offset values should be different then
the default values (4095 and 0). You can test if the calibration works in
principle by pressing "Calibrate" when the poti is in the middle position,
then one of the values has to change (after that you have to recalibrate,
of course).


.. _brickv_flash_firmware:

Brick Firmware Flashing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flashing of Brick firmwares can be done with Brick Viewer sind version 1.1.0.
The latest firmwares will be downloaded automatically and can be found
:ref:`here <downloads_firmwares_plugins>` too.

First bring the Brick into the bootloader modus. Press and hold the "Erase"
button of the Brick and connect it via USB to your PC.
The blue LED should be off. Now the Brick should be in the bootloader
(based on your operating system some sort of Atmel device could be detected).

Start the Brick Viewer and click "Flashing":

.. image:: /Images/Screenshots/brickv_flashing_firmware_small.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Brickv (Brick Firmware)
   :align: center
   :target: ../_images/Screenshots/brickv_flashing_firmware.jpg

A Brick in bootloader mode should show up as serial port.
The "Serial Port" dropdown box shows all detected serial ports. If no port is
listed try clicking "Refresh". If still no serial port shows up ensure that
your Brick is in bootloader mode and that it is correctly recognized by your
operating system.

Select the correct serial port, select the firmware for your Brick and click
"Save". Now the latest firmware will be downloaded and written to the Brick,
then read back again and verified to be correctly written.
A message box will pop up to inform you about the result.
If the flash process failed, check if you have selected the correct serial port.

Instead of letting the Brick Viewer download the latest firmware you can also
select "Custom..." from the dropdown box and specify a local file via the
"Browse..." button.

.. note::
 On Windows you might need to install Atmel driver ``atm6124_cdc.inf`` from the
 drivers subfolder in the Brick Viewer installation folder.

 If you have an old Linux kernel you might need to install the kernel driver
 from `here <http://www.embedded-it.de/en/microcontroller/eNet-sam7X.php>`__
 (at the bottom: "SAM-BA Linux USB driver")


.. _brickv_flash_plugin:

Bricklet Plugin Flashing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flashing of Bricklet plugins into the EEPROM of the Bricklet is
possible in the flashing window. The latest plugins will be downloaded
automatically and can be found :ref:`here <downloads_firmwares_plugins>` too.

Connect a Brick (any Brick will do) via USB, start the Brick Viewer
and, click "Connect" and then click "Flashing":

.. image:: /Images/Screenshots/brickv_flashing_plugin_small.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Brickv (Brick Plugin)
   :align: center
   :target: ../_images/Screenshots/brickv_flashing_plugin.jpg

Now connect the Bricklet that is to be flashed to the Brick and select
the corresponding Brick and Port.
Select the type of you Bricklet from the dropdown box. If you press "Save" now,
the latest plugin will be downloaded and written
to the EEPROM, then read again from the EEPROM and verified to be
correctly written. A message box will pop up to inform you about the result.
If the flash process failed, check if you selected the correct port and if the
Bricklet is connected properly.

Instead of letting the Brick Viewer download the latest plugin you can also
select "Custom..." from the dropdown box and specify a local file via the
"Browse..." button.

You can also read the UID currently written on the Bricklet and set a
new one. Note that the UID has to be in Base58 encoding
(i.e. 0-9a-zA-Z without 0 (zero), I (big i), O (big o) and l (small L)).
The only other restriction is that all Bricklet UIDs you use at the same
time need to be unique, you can use recognizable names or patterns.
