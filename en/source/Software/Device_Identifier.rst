Device Identifier
=================

Every Brick and Bricklet has a device identifier. This identifier is used
in the ``GetIdentity`` and enumeration functions. It allows a dynamical usage
of devices without the knowledge of UIDs.

The API bindings contain a device identifier constant for each Brick and
Bricklet. Details about this can be found in the section about constants in the
specific API documentation.
