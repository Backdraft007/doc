ESP32 Firmware
==============

The ESP32 firmware can be compiled in multiple variations to be used on different
devices:

* :ref:`ESP32 Brick <esp32_brick>`
* :ref:`ESP32 Ethernet Brick <esp32_ethernet_brick>`
* `WARP Charger <https://www.warp-charger.com/index_warp1.html>`__ Smart and Pro
* `WARP2 Charger <https://www.warp-charger.com/>`__ Smart and Pro

..
 * WARP Energy Manager, TODO: Link zur Dokumentation hinzuf√ºgen

The firmware is written and C/C++ and the source code is freely available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-firmware>`__. The
`Arduino ESP32 projekt <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/>`__
and PlatformIO are used as basis.

.. _esp32_firmware_setup:

Preparation
-----------

First, `PlatformIO <https://platformio.org/>`__ and `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`__
have to be installed according to their installation manuals. For PlatformIO we
recommend using the PlatformIO IDE extension for
`Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__.

Next, download the `esp32-firmware <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-firmware>`__
repository from GitHub as
`ZIP file <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-firmware/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`__
and unpack it or clone the repository using `git <https://www.git-scm.com/>`__.

The ``platformio.ini`` file is located in the ``software/`` subdirectory. Open
this subdirectory in Visual Studio Code and build the ``prepare`` environment
to prepare the build of other environments.

Firmware Building
-----------------

Choose the PlatformIO environment corresponding to the firmware variation you
want to build:

* ESP32 Brick: ``esp32``
* ESP32 Ethernet Brick: ``esp32_ethernet``
* WARP Charger Smart and Pro: ``warp``
* WARP2 Charger Smart and Pro: ``warp2``

..
 * WARP Energy Manager: ``energy_manager``

To build a specific firmware run its corresponding PlatformIO "Build" task.
To build a firmware, upload it to a Brick and connect to its serial console all
in on step you can run the PlatformIO "Upload and Monitor" task. This requires
that the Brick is connected to USB beforehand.

Firmware Structure
------------------

The functionality and the web interface of the firmware are put together from
modules. The variations of the firmware differ mostly in their list of active
modules. This list is specified per environment in the ``platformio.ini`` file
using the ``backend_modules`` and ``frontend_modules`` options.

The tutorial regarding the :ref:`ESP32 firmware <tutorial_esp32_firmware>`
shows step by step how to add a custom module to the firmware.
