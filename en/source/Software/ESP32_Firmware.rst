ESP32 Firmware
==============

The ESP32 firmware can be compiled in multiple variations to be used on different
devices:

* :ref:`ESP32 Brick <esp32_brick>`
* :ref:`ESP32 Ethernet Brick <esp32_ethernet_brick>`
* `WARP Charger <https://www.warp-charger.com/index_warp1.html>`__ Smart and Pro
* `WARP2 Charger <https://www.warp-charger.com/>`__ Smart and Pro

..
 * WARP Energy Manager, TODO: Link zur Dokumentation hinzuf√ºgen

The firmware is written and C/C++ and the source code is freely available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-firmware>`__. The
`Arduino ESP32 projekt <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/>`__
and PlatformIO are used as basis.

.. _esp32_firmware_setup:

Preparation
-----------

First, `PlatformIO <https://platformio.org/>`__, `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`__
and `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ have to be installed according to their
installation manuals. For PlatformIO we recommend using the PlatformIO IDE
extension for `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__, but you
can also use PlatformIO Core instead.

In general you should always use the latest version of PlatformIO and Node.js.
For the Node.js package manager ``npm`` version 8 or newer is required.

For Windows the `Silicon Labs CP210x Universal Windows Driver <https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers>`__
has to be installed. Linux and macOS have this driver already build in.

Next, download the `esp32-firmware <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-firmware>`__
repository from GitHub as
`ZIP file <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-firmware/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`__
and unpack it or clone the repository using `git <https://www.git-scm.com/>`__.

The ``platformio.ini`` file is located in the ``software/`` directory. Make sure
to open the ``software/`` directory in Visual Studio Code as the PlatformIO
project directory and build the ``prepare`` environment
to prepare the build of other environments. In general this has to be done only
once and not before every build of other environments

.. _esp32_firmware_build:

Firmware Building
-----------------

Choose the PlatformIO environment corresponding to the firmware variation you
want to build:

* ESP32 Brick: ``esp32`` defined in ``esp32.ini``
* ESP32 Ethernet Brick: ``esp32_ethernet`` defined in ``esp32_ethernet.ini``
* WARP Charger Smart and Pro: ``warp`` defined in ``warp.ini``
* WARP2 Charger Smart and Pro: ``warp2`` defined in ``warp2.ini``

..
 * WARP Energy Manager: ``energy_manager`` defined in ``energy_manager.ini``

To build a specific firmware run its corresponding PlatformIO "Build" task.
To build a firmware, upload it to a Brick and connect to its serial console all
in one step you can run the PlatformIO "Upload and Monitor" task. This requires
that the Brick is connected to USB beforehand.

Firmware Structure
------------------

The functionality and the web interface of the firmware are put together from
modules. The variations of the firmware differ mostly in their list of active
modules. This list is specified per environment in the corresponding ``.ini``
file using the ``custom_backend_modules`` and ``custom_frontend_modules`` options.

The tutorial regarding the :ref:`ESP32 firmware <tutorial_esp32_firmware>`
shows step by step how to add a custom module to the firmware.
