Features
--------

* Control Bricks/Bricklets wirelessly over your mobile phone or tablet
* Operates with 802.11b/g/n access points, WEP, WPA, WPA2 Personal and Enterprise encryption
* Equipped with 18dBm power amplifier for extended range
* External RP-SMA and U.FL antenna connector


Description
-----------

With this WIFI Extension 2.0 you can control :ref:`Bricks <primer_bricks>` and
:ref:`Bricklets <primer_bricklets>` wirelessly over your
mobile phone, tablet or your PC. For the Master Extension concept please take a look at the general
:ref:`description <primer_master_extensions>`.

..
 The devices supports two modes. In Full Speed Mode the device Wi-Fi transceiver is always on.
 New incoming data will be immediately handled. In Low Power Mode the devices is not always on,
 the transceiver enters sleep mode after each message. This leads to a significantly lower power
 consumption and data throughput.

Since the device itself handles TCP/IP packages generated by the API, it is possible to 
connect directly from your controlling device (mobile phone, tablet, (embedded) PC).
A :ref:`brick daemon <brickd>` is not necessary.

To use the WIFI Extension 2.0 a :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>` is mandatory.
The :ref:`RED Brick <red_brick>` is currently not supported.
If you want to use other Bricks, you can build a :ref:`stack <primer_stack>`
and plug them also on top of the Master Brick. If you want to use Bricklets you 
can attach them to the Master Brick or to other Bricks in the stack. From the 
programming perspective this is completely transparent, i.e. all Bricks and 
Bricklets can be used exactly the same way as if they were connected to your 
controlling device via USB.

You need a Master Brick with firmware version 1.4.0 or newer to use this 
extension.

The following combinations with other Extensions in a stack are possible
(regardless of order):

* WIFI / RS485 Master

WIFI Network
------------

With this Master Extension you will be able to create a wireless connection to
a Master Brick and all of its connected Bricks and Bricklets.
A Brick Daemon is not required.

If you want to connect the Brick Viewer with your WIFI setup,
you have to enter the IP of the WIFI Extension 2.0 and the configured port
in the Setup Tab. After pressing "Connect" you will not connect to your local
running Brick Daemon but to your WIFI Extension 2.0.

   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_brickv.jpg

For your own code modify the host and port in your ``connect`` call, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

 ipcon.connect("localhost", 4223)

has to be changed to

.. code-block:: python

 ipcon.connect("192.168.0.25", 4223)


.. _wifi_configuration:

WIFI Configuration
------------------

To configure the WIFI Extension 2.0 open the Master Brick Tab in the Brick Viewer.
First of all you have to enter the SSID of your wireless network. The SSID is
the name of the wireless network to which the WIFI Extension 2.0 should connect to
in client mode, respectively it is the name of the wireless network the WIFI
Extension provides in access point mode or ad hoc mode (this section focuses
on client mode). The SSID can be 32 ASCII characters long (quotation mark is
not allowed).

Then you have to select DHCP or static IP address configuration. In case of
you want to use DHCP simply select DHCP and configure the port.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_dhcp.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure connection as DHCP
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_dhcp.jpg

If you want to use a static IP address you have to configure that IP and the port.
Additionally configure the subnet mask and gateway address.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_static.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure connection as static IP
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_static.jpg

We suggest that you use an encrypted network. You can choose between
WPA/WPA2, WPA Enterprise (EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, PEAP) and WEP.

For WPA you only have to enter the key (limited to ASCII characters, without
the quotation mark).

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure WPA encryption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa.jpg

For WPA Enterprise configure outer auth (FAST, TLS, TTLS, PEAP),
inner auth (MSCHAP, GTC), user, password and add the necessary certificates (ca cert, client cert, private key).

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa_enterprise.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure WPA Enterprise encryption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa_enterprise.jpg

For WEP enter the key and the key index. If the key index is unknown it is likely 1.
Please enter your key in hex notation with the full key length
(depending on 64bit and 128bit key).

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wep.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure WEP encryption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wep.jpg

.. note::
 WEP encryption has been broken and it doesn't provide any real security
 anymore. We strongly suggest to use WPA/WPA2 instead.

If you don't want encryption select "No Encryption".

Finally you have to configure the Power Mode. There are two Power Modes:
Full Speed and Low Power. In Full Speed mode the device consumes more power,
but you will be able to transmit much more messages. This will be the typical
configuration. If you only need to transmit only a few messages per second
(e.g. if you want to measure temperatures wirelessly, than you might to use
the Low Power Mode and save energy.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_power_mode.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure Power Mode
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_power_mode.jpg

.. note::
 The Power Mode is not saved permanently, it will automatically switch back
 to Full Speed on reset of the Master Brick. Because Low Power Mode is not fast enough for the
 initial enumeration after a reset. Therefore, you need to enable Low Power
 Mode after each reset.

At the end, press "Save WIFI Configuration" to save the configuration permanently
on the WIFI Extension 2.0. If another option besides the Power Mode has be changed
then the Master Brick has to be restarted to apply the new configuration.
After restart you should be able to reach the Master Brick by entering the IP
address and port of the Brick in the Brick Viewer.

Example: Client Mode with dynamic IP Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This examples shows how to configure the WIFI Extension 2.0 to connect to a typical
Wi-Fi access point. This example assumes that the SSID of your access point is
"MyHomeNetwork" and that it is using WPA/WPA2 encryption with "1234567890ABCDEF"
as key.

Firstly, enter the SSID (the name of your Wi-Fi network) to connect to. For
example:

* SSID: MyHomeNetwork

Next, enter a Hostname that you can use to connect to the WIFI Extension 2.0 without
having to figure out which dynamic IP address got assigned to it. For example:

* Hostname: WIFI-Extension

Secondly, select "Client: DHCP" for the Mode and Address, "WPA/WPA2" for
Encryption and enter the WPA/WPA2 key. For example:

* Key: 1234567890ABCDEF

Save the WIFI configuration and restart the Master Brick. Now the WIFI Extension 2.0
should connect to your access point and you should be able to connect to it with
your program and Brick Viewer using "WIFI-Extension" as host.


.. _extension_wifi_adhoc_ap:

Access Point Mode and Ad Hoc Mode
---------------------------------

.. note::
 Access Point and Ad Hoc mode are available in Master Brick firmware
 version 1.3.3 and Brick Viewer version 1.1.8 and newer.

It is possible to communicate with the WIFI Extension 2.0 without an external
Access Point. To allow that, the WIFI Extension 2.0 implements an
Access Point and an Ad Hoc mode. Since Ad Hoc mode needs to be specifically
supported by the device you want to connect with, we recommend the
use of Access Point mode. In AP mode the WIFI Extension 2.0 simulates an
access point and should show up as a normal access point on your PC.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_adhoc_ap.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure Ad Hoc or Access Point mode
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_adhoc_ap.jpg

You can choose Ad Hoc and Access Point mode with DHCP and static IP.
If you choose DHCP you have to provide the DHCP server! There is no DHCP
server implementation in the Wi-Fi module. Since that can be quite
cumbersome to get running, we recommend that you use static IP.

As encryption you can use WEP. WPA is unfortunately not supported in
Ad Hoc and Access Point mode. The WEP key should be 64 or 128 bit and
in hexadecimal notation. You can generate valid WEP keys
`here <http://www.andrewscompanies.com/tools/wep.asp>`__.

Example: Access Point Mode with static IP Address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This examples shows how to configure the WIFI Extension 2.0 as access point with
a static IP address and how to connect an Android smart phone to it.

Firstly, select a SSID (the name of the Wi-Fi network). Make sure to use a
name that is not already used by another Wi-Fi network near you. For example:

* SSID: TinkerforgeWLAN

Secondly, select "Access Point: Static IP" for the Mode and Address and
configure IP, Subnet Mask and Gateway. For example:

* IP: 192.168.1.17
* Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
* Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Select "No Encryption" or "WEP" for Encryption. If "WEP" should be used then
you also have to provide a Key. A 64 or 128 bit WEP key can be generated
`here <http://www.andrewscompanies.com/tools/wep.asp>`__. The key has to be
entered in hexadecimal notation.

.. note::
 WEP encryption has been broken and it doesn't provide any real security
 anymore. Unfortunately the WIFI Extension 2.0 doesn't support WPA/WPA2 encryption
 in Ad Hoc and Access Point mode.

Save the WIFI configuration and restart the Master Brick. Now the WIFI Extension 2.0
should act as an access point.

Thirdly, open the Wi-Fi settings on your Android smart phone and add a new
network. Enter the SSID of the WIFI Extension 2.0 (default: TinkerforgeWLAN)
and select "None" or "WEP" for Security, according to the configuration of the
WIFI Extension 2.0. If you selected WEP you have to enter the generated WEP key as
Password in hexadecimal notation.

The WIFI Extension 2.0 does not provide its own DHCP server, therefore you have to
configure a static IP address for your smart phone in the advanced options.
Change the IP settings from "DHCP" to "Static" and enter IP address, Gateway
and Network prefix length. For example:

* IP address: 192.168.1.23
* Gateway: 192.168.1.1
* Network prefix length: 24

Finally, save the new network configuration and connect to it. Now your smart
phone should be connected to the access point of the WIFI Extension 2.0.


.. _extension_wifi_authentication:

Authentication
--------------

The WIFI Extension 2.0 supports authentication since Master Brick firmware
version 2.2.0. Authentication is disabled by default. Tick the "Use
Authentication" check box and choose an authentication secret to enable it.
This secret can be 64 ASCII characters long. After saving the configuration
and restarting the Master Brick authentication is enabled.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_authentication.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure Authentication
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_authentication.jpg

Now every TCP/IP connection to the WIFI Extension 2.0 has to prove to the
Master Brick that it knows the authentication secret before normal communication
can occur. See the :ref:`authentication tutorial <tutorial_authentication>`
for more information.
