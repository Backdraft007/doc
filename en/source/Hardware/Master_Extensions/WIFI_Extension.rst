Features
--------

* Control Bricks/Bricklets wirelessly over your mobile phone or tablet
* Operates with 802.11b/g/n access points, WEP, WPA, WPA2 Personal and Enterprise encryption
* Equipped with 18dBm power amplifier for extended range
* External RP-SMA and U.FL antenna connector


Description
-----------

With this WIFI Extension you can control :ref:`Bricks <product_overview_bricks>` and
:ref:`Bricklets <product_overview_bricklets>` wirelessly over your
mobile phone, tablet or your PC. For the Master Extension concept please take a look at the general
:ref:`description <product_overview_master_extensions>`. The Extension is equipped with a `GainSpan <http://www.gainspan.com>`__
`GS1011MEES <http://www.gainspan.com/gs1011mees>`__ WIFI module with an internal power amplifier
which allows for superior range compared to other WIFI modules.

The devices supports two modes. In Full Speed Mode the device WIFI transceiver is always on.
New incoming data will be immediately handled. In Low Power Mode the devices is not always on,
the transceiver enters sleep mode after each message. This leads to a significantly lower power
consumption and data throughput.

Since the device itself handles TCP/IP packages generated by the API, it is possible to connect directly from your controlling
device (mobile phone, tablet, (embedded) PC). A :ref:`brick daemon <brickd>` is not necessary.

To use the WIFI Extension a :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>` is mandatory.
If you want to use other Bricks, you can build a stack and plug them also on top
of the Master Brick. If you want to use Bricklets you can attach them to the Master Brick or
to other Bricks in the stack. From the programming perspective
this is completely transparent, i.e. all Bricks and Bricklets can
be used exactly the same way as if they were connected to your controlling device via USB.

You need a Master Brick with firmware version 1.3.0 or newer to use this extension.

The following combinations with other Extensions in a stack are possible:

* WIFI top / RS485 Master bottom
* WIFI bottom / RS485 Master top

.. _wifi_network_assembly:

WIFI Network
------------

With this Master Extension you will be able to create a wireless connection to
a Master Brick and all of its connected Bricks and Bricklets.
No Brick Deamon is necessary if you use this Extension.

If you want to connect the Brick Viewer with your WIFI setup,
you have to enter the IP of the WIFI Extension and the configured port
in the Setup Tab. After pressing "Connect" you will not connect to your local
running Brick Daemon but to your WIFI Extension.

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Brick Viewer configration for WIFI Extension
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_brickv.jpg

For your own code modify the passed host and port
at your IPConnection call, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

 ipcon = IPConnection("localhost", 4223)

has to be changed to

.. code-block:: python

 ipcon = IPConnection("192.168.0.25", 4223)



.. _wifi_configuration:

WIFI Configuration
------------------

To configure the WIFI Extension open the Master Brick Tab in the Brick Viewer.
First of all you have to enter the SSID (limited to ASCII characters, without
the quotation mark) of your wireless network and if the device should use DHCP
or a static IP.

In case of you want to use DHCP simply select DHCP and configure the port.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_dhcp.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure connection as DHCP
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_dhcp.jpg

If you want to use a static IP address you have to configure that IP and the port.
Additionally configure the subnet mask and gateway address.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_static.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure connection as static IP
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_static.jpg

We suggest that you use an encrypted network. You can choose between
WPA/WPA2, WPA Enterprise (EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, PEAP) and WEP.

For WPA you only have to enter the key (limited to ASCII characters, without
the quotation mark).

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure WPA encryption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa.jpg

For WPA Enterprise configure outer auth (FAST, TLS, TTLS, PEAP), 
inner auth (MSCHAP, GTC), user, password and add the necessary certificates (ca cert, client cert, private key).

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa_enterprise.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure WPA Enterprise encryption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wpa_enterprise.jpg

For WEP enter the key and the key index. If the key index is unknown it is likely 1.
Please enter your key in hex notation with the full key length 
(depending on 64bit and 128bit key).

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wep.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure WEP encryption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_encryption_wep.jpg

If you don't want encryption select "No Encryption". 

Finally you have to configure the Power Mode. There are two Power Modes:
Full Speed and Low Power. In Full Speed mode the device consumes more power,
but you will be able to transmit much more messages. This will be the typical
configuration. If you only need to transmit only a few messages per second
(e.g. if you want to measure temperatures wirelessly, than you might to use
the Low Power Mode and save energy.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_power_mode.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure Power Mode
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_power_mode.jpg

.. note::
 The Power Mode is not saved permanently, it will automatically switch back
 to Full Speed on reset of the Master Brick. Because Low Power Mode is not fast enough for the
 initial enumeration after a reset. Therefore, you need to enable Low Power
 Mode after each reset.

At the end, press "Save WIFI Configuration" to save the configuration. If another
option then the Master Brick has to be restarted to apply the new configuration.
After restart you should be able to reach the Master Brick by entering the IP
address and port of the Brick in the Brick Viewer.


.. _extension_wifi_adhoc_ap:

Access Point Mode and Ad Hoc Mode
---------------------------------

.. note::
 Access Point and Ad Hoc mode are available in Master Brick firmware
 version 1.3.3 and Brick Viewer version 1.1.8 and newer.

It is possible to communicate with the WIFI Extension without an external
Access Point. To allow that, the WIFI Extension implements an
Access Point and an Ad Hoc mode. Since Ad Hoc mode needs to be specifically
supported by the device you want to connect with, we recommend the
use of Access Point mode. In AP mode the WIFI Extension simulates an
access point and should show up as a normal access point on your PC.

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_adhoc_ap.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Configure Ad Hoc or Access Point mode
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_connection_adhoc_ap.jpg

You can choose Ad Hoc and Access Point mode with DHCP and static IP.
If you choose DHCP you have to provide the DHCP server! There is no DHCP
server implementation in the WIFI module. Since that can be quite
cumbersome to get running, we recommend that you use static IP.

As encryption you can use WEP. WPA is unfortunately not supported in
Ad Hoc and Access Point mode. The WEP key should be 64 or 128 bit and
in hexadecimal notation. You can generate valid WEP keys 
`here <http://www.andrewscompanies.com/tools/wep.asp>`__.


.. _extension_wifi_leds:

LEDs and Connectivity
---------------------

.. image:: /Images/Extensions/extension_wifi_caption_600.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: WIFI Extension with caption
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Extensions/extension_wifi_caption_800.jpg

The blue power LED will be on permanently if the device is powered.
The green LED is the status LED (permanently off = error, blink = associating, on = associated).

The WIFI module is equipped with an U.FL connector and an 75 Ohm U.FL to RP-SMA pigtail cable.
Depending on your application it is possible to disconnect the pigtail cable
and connect your own cable.
