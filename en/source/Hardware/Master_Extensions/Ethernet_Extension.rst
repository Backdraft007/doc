Features
--------

* Communicate directly with Bricks/Bricklets without Brickd
* Supports 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet (1000 Mbit/s compatible)
* Integrated PoE Power Supply (PD Class 0 for IEEE 802.3af)

 * Can power a Stack via Ethernet Cable



Description
-----------

With this Ethernet Extension you can control 
:ref:`Bricks <product_overview_bricks>` and
:ref:`Bricklets <product_overview_bricklets>` and integrate them into a 
`LAN <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Area_Network>`__. 
The module supports 10BaseT/100BaseTX Ethernet and is 1000BaseTX 
compatible. The integrated 
`PoE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet>`__
power supply allows to power the connected modules over industry standard
IEEE 802.3af such that a PoE injector as well as PoE 
switches can be used to power stacks.

Since the device itself handles TCP/IP packages generated by the API, it is 
possible to connect directly from your controlling device 
(mobile phone, tablet, (embedded) PC). A :ref:`Brick Daemon <brickd>` is not 
necessary.

To use the Ethernet Extension a :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>` is mandatory.
If you want to use other Bricks, you can build a stack and plug them also on top
of the Master Brick. If you want to use Bricklets you can attach them to the Master Brick or
to other Bricks in the stack. From the programming perspective
this is completely transparent, i.e. all Bricks and Bricklets can
be used exactly the same way as if they were connected to your controlling device via USB.


You need a Master Brick with firmware version 2.1.0 or newer to use this 
extension.

The following combinations with other Extensions in a stack are possible 
(regardless of order):

* Ethernet / RS485 Master
* Ethernet / Chibi

.. _ethernet_configuration:

Ethernet Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ethernet Extension can be configured in two different modi: 
DHCP or static IP. If you use a static IP you have to enter 
**IP**, **Subnet Mask** and **Gateway**.

The MAC address of the Ethernet is not fixed in hardware, it will be allocated
by Tinkerforge. If it is lost in the EEPROM it can be found on the sticker of
the Ethernet Extension.

After configuring the Ethernet Extension you have to press the button
"Save Ethernet Configuration" and restart the Master Brick.

PoE Power Supply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PoE injectors can be used to supply Bricks and Bricklets over Ethernet. 
The Ethernet Extension will power the complete stack
Activeted PoE will be signeld by a green LED on the Ethernet Extension.

Servos and (stepper-) motors connected to DC-, Servo- or Stepper Bricks can not
be powered by PoE since the PoE voltage typically is too high.

The Ethernet Extension can be used together with a Step-Down Power Supply.

Programming Interfaces

High Level Programming Interface
