Ethernet Extension
==================

Features
--------

* Communicate directly with Bricks/Bricklets without Brickd
* Supports 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet (1000 Mbit/s compatible)
* Integrated PoE Power Supply (PD Class 0 for IEEE 802.3af)

 * Can power a Stack via Ethernet Cable



Description
-----------

With this Ethernet Extension you can control 
:ref:`Bricks <product_overview_bricks>` and
:ref:`Bricklets <product_overview_bricklets>` integrate into a 
`LAN <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Area_Network>`__. 
The module supports 10BaseT/100BaseTX Ethernet and is 1000BaseTX 
compatible. The integrated 
`PoE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet>`__
power supply supports to power the connected modules over industry standard
IEEE 802.3af such that low priced PoE injectors as well as high end PoE 
switches can be used.

Since the device itself handles TCP/IP packages generated by the API, it is 
possible to connect directly from your controlling device (mobile phone, tablet, 
(embedded) PC). A :ref:`Brick Daemon <brickd>` is not necessary.

To use the Ethernet Extension a :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>` is mandatory.
If you want to use other Bricks, you can build a stack and plug them also on top
of the Master Brick. If you want to use Bricklets you can attach them to the Master Brick or
to other Bricks in the stack. From the programming perspective
this is completely transparent, i.e. all Bricks and Bricklets can
be used exactly the same way as if they were connected to your controlling device via USB.


You need a Master Brick with firmware version 2.1.0 or newer to use this extension.

The following combinations with other Extension ins a stack are possible (a specific 
order is not necessary):

* Ethernet / RS485 Master
* Ethernet / Chibi

Connectivity
------------

The following picture depicts the different connection possibilities.


.. _ethernet_configuration:

Ethernet Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ethernet Extension can be configured in two different modi: 
DHCP or static IP. If you use a static IP you have to input
**IP**, **Subnet Mask** and **Gateway**.

The MAC address of the Ethernet is not fixed in hardware, it will be allocated
by Tinkerforge. If it is lost for some reason it can be found on the sticker at
the Ethernet Extension.

After configuring the Ethernet Extension you have to press the button
"Save Ethernet Configuration" and restart the Master Brick.

PoE Power Supply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To supply Bricks and Bricklets via PoE low priced PoE injectors can be used for
example. The Ethernet Extension will power the stack, such that all Bricks and 
Bricklets can be used. Active PoE will be signeld by a green LED on the Ethernet
Extension.

Servos and (stepper-) motors connected to DC-, Servo- or Stepper Bricks can not
be powered by PoE since the PoE voltage typically is too high.

The Ethernet Extension can be used without problem with a Step-Down Power Supply.
