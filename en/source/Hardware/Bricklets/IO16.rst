Features
--------

* 16-channel digital input/output
* Switchable logic voltage 3.3V or 5V*
* Configurable pull-ups and interrupts


.. _io16_bricklet_description:

Description
-----------

The IO-16 :ref:`Bricklet <primer_bricklets>` can be used to extend
the features of :ref:`Bricks <primer_bricks>` by external digital
inputs and outputs.

The Bricklet features 2x 8 I/O pins that can be independently configured as
digital inputs or outputs. Each input pin can additionally be configured with
a pull-up or as interrupt source. The input/output voltages can be switched
manually between 3.3V and 5V*. Via terminal blocks all signals
and GND can be accessed. An additional terminal block
delivers the switched output voltage.

Human interfaces, such as switches, push-buttons and LEDs are typical
applications of this Bricklet.

================================  =================================================================

\* The maximum output voltage depends on supply voltage. If the connected Brick is
powered over USB, 5V may not be reached. The reason for this is a voltage
drop about 0.5V caused by protection diodes on our products.
If you need to reach 5V, you have to use a stack supply,
e.g. the :ref:`Step-Down Power Supply <step_down_power_supply>`.

\** depends on your system (OS, CPU etc.)

.. _io16_bricklet_test:

Test your IO-16 Bricklet
------------------------

|test_intro|

|test_connect|.
In our test we connected an LED with series resistor to the board
by attaching the anode to port B pin 0 and the cathode to a GND pin.
Additionally we connected a slide switch that can short port A pin 7 to GND
(see picture below).

If everything went as expected the Brick Viewer should look as
depicted below.

  FIXME: update screenshot and description for monoflop

In this tab you can change the "Debounce Period",
it is the debounce time for interrupt callbacks.
For example: If you set this value to 100, you will get interrupts
maximal every 100ms. This is necessary if something that bounces is
connected to the IO-16 Bricklet, such as a button. You can test the optimal
value in the Brick Viewer and use it later in your own program.

Below the debounce period configuration you can configure the pins.
Each pin can be configured as input/output and in case of an input pin
as pull-up. The current state is depicted in the table below.

To test the LED we configure port B pin 0 as output and change
the value. When the pin is high the LED should light up. To test the button
configure port A pin 7 as input pull-up. We need the pull-up to define a stable
state when the slide switch does not short port A pin 7 to GND. Now look in the
table, you should see that you can change the value of the pin by toggling the
slide switch.

If you don't have a button or a LED you can try to measure voltages with
a voltage meter or connect an input pin with GND or VCC to see changes in the
Brick Viewer.
