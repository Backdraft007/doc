Features
--------

* 1-wire communication with any 1-wire capable device
* Offers high-level commands (bus search, reset, write, read, write command)
* Supports 3.3V, 5V and external supply voltage
* Supports up to 64 1-wire devices simultaneously


.. _one_wire_bricklet_description:

Description
-----------

The One-Wire Bricklet can be used to communicate with any
`1-wire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire>`__ capable device.

The API uses a set of high-level commands (bus search, reset, write, read,
write command). Each command will give immediate status feedback for easy error
detection.

Up to 64 devices can be connected to the bus and used at the same time.

A jumper can be used to switch between 3.3V, 5V or an external supply voltage
for the connected 1-wire devices.

An example application would be to read the temperature of a MAX31820
1-wire ambient temperature sensor.

This Bricklet ist not galvanically isolated to the Tinkerforge system. 
This means that there is a direct electrical connection between the terminals 
of the Bricklet and the rest of the system. Dependent of the application 
this can lead to undesired connections, ground loops or short circuits. 
These problems can be prevented by using the Bricklet together with a :ref:`Isolator Bricklet <isolator_bricklet>`.

The One Wire Bricklet has a 7 pole Bricklet connector and is connected to a
Brick with a ``7p-10p`` Bricklet cable.

Connectivity
------------

You can connect any 1-Wire device to the VCC/DAT/GND (voltage, data, ground) pins.

The jumper can be used to switch the supply voltage applied to VCC between 3.3V and 5V.
If the jumper is set to NC, you can connect an external power supply to VCC. If you want
to use an external power supply, you can not put the jumper on the 3.3V/5V pin headers.

Example: MAX31820
-----------------

The following example uses Python to read the temperature of a MAX31820
temperature sensor with the API of the One Wire Bricklet:

.. code-block:: python

    ow.write_command(0, 0x4E)     # WRITE SCRATCH PAD
    ow.write(0x00)                # ALARM H (unused)
    ow.write(0x00)                # ALARM L (unused)
    ow.write(0x7F)                # CONFIGURATION: 12 bit mode

    while True:
        ow.write_command(0, 0x44) # CONVERT T (start temperature conversion)
        time.sleep(1)             # Wait for conversion to finish

        ow.write_command(0, 0xBE) # READ SCRATCH PAD

        t_low = ow.read().data    # Read LSB
        t_high = ow.read().data   # Read MSB

        print('Temperature: {0} Â°C'.format((t_low | (t_high << 8)) / 16.0))
