.. note::

 The Distance US Bricklet is discontinued and is no longer sold. The
 Distance US Bricklet 2.0 is still in development. For now, the
 :ref:`Distance IR Bricklet 2.0 <distance_ir_v2_bricklet>` and the
 :ref:`Laser Range Finder Bricklet 2.0 <laser_range_finder_v2_bricklet>` are
 possible replacements.

Features
--------

* Measures distances from 2cm to 400cm with ultrasound
* 12bit resolution


.. _distance_us_bricklet_description:

Description
-----------

The Distance US :ref:`Bricklet <primer_bricklets>` is equipped with
an `ultrasonic distance sensor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_sensor>`__
and extends :ref:`Bricks <primer_bricks>` by the possibility to measure 
distances from 2cm to 400cm.
The measured distance is reported as unitless value, not in mm. This is because
the relation between the distance value and the actual distance depends on the
exact value of the 5V supply voltage. Deviations in the supply voltage result
in deviations in the measured distance values.
With configurable events it is possible to react on changing distances without
polling. Typical applications can be found in robotics, usage as light barrier
alternative and so on.

Case
----

A `laser-cut case for the Distance US Bricklet
<https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/cases/case-distance-us-bricklet.html>`__ is available.

   :target: ../../_images/Cases/bricklet_distance_us_case_front_1000.jpg

The assembly is easiest if you follow the following steps:

* Screw spacers to the Bricklet (each long spacer consists of 2x 9mm and 1x 12mm pieces),
* build up side plates and put them around Bricklet and sensor (the front plate is asymmetric, the wider margin goes to the right side, when viewed from the outside),
* screw bottom plate to bottom spacers,
* screw top plate to top spacers.

Below you can see an exploded assembly drawing of the Distance US Bricklet case:
