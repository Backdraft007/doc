.. _ptc_v2_bricklet_description:

Description
-----------

The PTC :ref:`Bricklet <primer_bricklets>` 2.0 can be used to
extend the features of :ref:`Bricks <primer_bricks>` by the
capability to measure temperature with Pt100 and Pt1000 sensors.

Pt100 and Pt1000 sensors of 2-wire, 3-wire or 4-wire type can be used.

The measured temperature can be read out in `째C
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_Celsius>`__.
With configurable events it is possible to react on changing
temperatures without polling.

This Bricklet ist not galvanically isolated to the Tinkerforge system. 
This means that there is a direct electrical connection between the terminals 
of the Bricklet and the rest of the system. Dependent of the application 
this can lead to undesired connections, ground loops or short circuits. 
These problems can be prevented by using the Bricklet together with a :ref:`Isolator Bricklet <isolator_bricklet>`.

The PTC Bricklet 2.0 has a 7 pole Bricklet connector and is connected to a
Brick with a ``7p-10p`` Bricklet cable.

.. _ptc_v2_bricklet_jumper_configuration:

Jumper Configuration
--------------------

Configure the jumper for Pt100/Pt1000 sensor and 2/3/4-wire type as
shown below. The pins of the pin headers that are marked red have to be closed
by a jumper for the corresponding sensor type.

Additionally the number of wires has to be set with the API.

.. _ptc_v2_bricklet_test:

Test your PTC Bricklet 2.0
--------------------------

|test_intro|

|test_connect|  and attach a Pt100/1000 sensor (see picture below).
In this example we use a 2-wire Pt100 sensor.

|test_tab|
If everything went as expected the Brick Viewer should look as
depicted below.

Put the sensor in your hand to see the
temperature rising (or falling if it is extremely warm in your room).
