.. _sound_pressure_level_bricklet_accuracy:

Accuracy and Calibration
------------------------

The Bricklet is calibrated against a sound pressure level meter with
1.5dB accuracy. The utilized MEMS microphone has a non-flat frequency
response with up to 1.5dB deviation in the range of 100Hz to 8kHz.

We add another 2dB for small variations in the mounting and the small
whole in the Bricklet etc to reach the specification of +-5dB.

For frequencies from 8kHz to 20kHz the deviation in frequency response
increases significantly. We calibrated this range in accordance to the
ICS43432 datasheet, but we can't give any guarantees in this range. We
were not able to compare this to a "ground truth"-value, since most
professional sound pressure level meters only measure up to 8kHz.

Additionally, the frequency response changes between microphones. To
calibrate this we would have to calibrate in an anechoic chamber for
each Bricklet. This is not economically feasable for a Bricklet.
We account for this with an additional absolute maximum 5% full-scale
error.

In our tests we found that the noise floor of the Bricklet is at about
30dB and we measured values up to 120dB.

The Bricklet is not tested with regards to IEC 61252:1993 class 1 or 2 
or IEC 61672 part 2 and it does not have "Pattern Approval".

As a general rule of thumb: The Bricklet will perform about as well
as other sub-200â‚¬ sound pressure level meters. Do not use this Bricklet
for measurements that have important health or safety implications!
