Barometer Bricklet
==================


Features
--------

* Measures barometric pressure and altitude changes
* Resolution 0.012mbar / 0.1m
* Range 10 to 1200mbar

Description
-----------

The Barometer Bricklet can be used to extend the features of Bricks by the capability to
measure barometric pressure in range of 10 to 1200mbar with a resolution of 0.012mbar. 
An internal temperature sensor corrects the measured values. 
The device is equipped with a MS5611-01BA01 sensor which is designed to be used as
altimeter. Since the barometric pressure is changing significantly during the day 
this have to be compensated in case of usage as altimeter. One possibility
is to make sensor fusion with `IMU Brick <brick_imu>` data.
