Features
--------

* Full fledged AHRS with 9 degrees of freedom
* No accumulating errors, no gimbal lock!
* Factory calibrated, easy to recalibrate
* Calculates quaternions as well as roll, pitch and yaw
* One USB port and two Bricklet ports


Description
-----------

The IMU :ref:`Brick <product_overview_bricks>` is equipped with a 32-bit ARM
microcontroller and an `inertial measurement unit
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit>`__.
It has 9 degrees of freedom and consists of a 3-axis accelerometer,
magnetometer and gyroscope. The board computes
`quaternions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation>`__
as well as `roll, pitch and yaw
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rollpitchyawplain.png>`__ information,
it is a complete `attitude and heading reference system
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHRS>`__.
The API allows access to the calculated data and
also the acceleration, magnetic field and angular velocity for the
three axes. If the quaternion representation is used, the IMU Brick does
not have a `gimbal lock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock>`__,
as known from Euler angles.

It is compatible to other Tinkerforge
:ref:`Bricks <product_overview_bricks>`
and can be used within a stack.
Two :ref:`Bricklet <product_overview_bricklets>` ports
can be used to extend the features of this device.

Controlling the device is possible in several ways. You can control it via
a PC connection. This connection can be established directly with a **USB**
cable or by other cable based (**RS485**, **Ethernet**) or wireless
(**WIFI**) connections via an additional Master Brick with
corresponding Master Extension (:ref:`High Level Concept <pi_hlpi>`).

Since the firmware is open source it is possible to program the device
directly (:ref:`On Device Programming <pi_odpi>`).
Currently we are not offering an On Device API.

The following picture depicts the different connection possibilities of the
IMU Brick.

You can see all of the available data form the IMU Brick. If you hold the
IMU Brick in the orientation as shown in the image and press
"Save Orientation", the movements that you make with the IMU Brick should be
mirrored in the Brick Viewer. Before you press "Save Orientation" you should
hold the IMU Brick still for about 15 seconds, so it can converge to the
correct position.

IMU Calibration
---------------

The IMU Brick comes factory calibrated and should work out of the box. It is
however easy to recalibrate, if necessary.

The factory calibration has taken place in a room without any significant
magnetic fields. If you want to operate the IMU Brick near something that
has a magnetic field (e.g. near a motor), you will have to recalibrate
the magnetometer in the exact position where it will be used later on!

To calibrate the magnetometer press on "Calibrate" in the Brick Viewer and
choose "Magnetometer" in the tab of the new window. Press "Start Calibration"
and now change the orientation of the IMU Brick until the bias and gain values
shown in the GUI do not change anymore. Press "Ready" when this is the case
and you are done.

Accelerometer and gyroscope can be calibrated similarly, follow the
instructions as given by the calibration tool. We recommend that you
export the calibration before you start recalibrating the accelerometer
and the gyroscope, so you are able to go back to the old calibration.

We recommend that you don't try to recalibrate the gyroscope gain, it is not
possible without suitable external machinery.

The factory calibration for your IMU Brick can be found at:
http://download.tinkerforge.com/imu_calibration/YOUR_IMU_UID.txt
(replace YOUR_IMU_UID by the UID of your IMU Brick).
If you accidentally miscalibrated a sensor or you
flashed a new firmware version, you can reimport the factory calibration.


Quaternions vs Euler Angles
---------------------------

We highly recommend that you use
`quaternions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation>`__
in your project rather than Euler angles (`roll, pitch and yaw
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rollpitchyawplain.png>`__), since the latter
exhibits a `gimbal lock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock>`__.

A formula to transform quaternions to rotation matrices can be found in the
API documentation. Note that Euler angles always have an order in which they
are applied. The order is: roll, yaw, pitch.


How to get angles that are independent?
---------------------------------------
It is not possible to get angles for all 3 axis that are completely independent.
At least at the gimbal lock positions there will be jumps of 180 degree for
some of the angles. This is simply not possible otherwise.

If you want rotation angles for the x, y and z axis for a given base
position, you have to rotate the quaternion according to your base
position and calculate the angles after that. The following Python example should
do exactly that and it should be easy to understand and translate in other
languages. Note that there are gimbal locks at +90 and -90 degree from each of the
angles. The base position will be 0, 0, 0::

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

	from tinkerforge.ip_connection import IPConnection
	from tinkerforge.brick_imu import IMU

	import math
	import time

	class Q:
		HOST = "localhost"
		PORT = 4223
		UID = "9yEBJVEHaem" # Change to your UID

		def __init__(self):

			self.ipcon.add_device(self.imu) # Add device to IP connection
			# Don't use device before it is added to a connection

			# Wait for IMU to settle
			print 'Set IMU to base position and wait for 10 seconds'
			print 'Base position will be 0 for all angles'
			time.sleep(10)
			q = self.imu.get_quaternion()
			self.set_base_coordinates(q.x, q.y, q.z, q.w)

			# Set period for quaternion callback to 10ms
			self.imu.set_quaternion_period(10)

			self.imu.register_callback(self.imu.CALLBACK_QUATERNION, self.quaternion_cb)

		def quaternion_cb(self, x, y, z, w):
			# Use conjugate of quaternion to rotate coordinates according to base system
			x, y, z, w = self.make_relative_coordinates(-x, -y, -z, w)

			x_angle = int(math.atan2(2.0*(y*z - w*x), 1.0 - 2.0*(x*x + y*y))*180/math.pi)
			y_angle = int(math.atan2(2.0*(x*z + w*y), 1.0 - 2.0*(x*x + y*y))*180/math.pi)
			z_angle = int(math.atan2(2.0*(x*y + w*z), 1.0 - 2.0*(x*x + z*z))*180/math.pi)

			print 'x: {0}, y: {1}, z: {2}'.format(x_angle, y_angle, z_angle)

		def set_base_coordinates(self, x, y, z, w):
			self.base_x = x

			return (

				w * self.base_w - x * self.base_x - y * self.base_y - z * self.base_z
			)

What is this sorcery, how does it work?
----------------------------------------
With the sensor data gathered by the IMU Brick (angular velocity, acceleration,
magnetic field), it is possible to apply sensor fusion to acquire an absolute
orientation.

For this process often a
`Kalman Filter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter>`__ is used.
The filter that is used in the IMU Brick is based on
`this paper <http://imumargalgorithm30042010sohm.googlecode.com/files/An%20efficient%20orientation%20filter%20for%20inertial%20and%20inertialmagnetic%20sensor%20arrays.pdf>`__
by S. O. Madgwick. In our tests this new state of the art filter
could achieve significantly better results than a Kalman Filter.

Madgwick's filter calculates the orientation by numerically integrating the
estimated orientation rate. It is computed as the rate of change of
orientation measured by the gyroscopes. The magnitude of the gyroscope
measurement error is removed in the direction of the estimated error,
which is computed from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements.
