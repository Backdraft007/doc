.. _imu_brick_description:

Description
-----------

The IMU :ref:`Brick <primer_bricks>` is equipped with a 3-axis 
accelerometer, magnetometer (compass) and gyroscope and works as a **USB**
`inertial measurement unit <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit>`__.
It can measure 9 degrees of freedom and computes
`quaternions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation>`__
as well as `roll, pitch and yaw
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rollpitchyawplain.png>`__ information.
It is a complete `attitude and heading reference system
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHRS>`__.

The API, provided for many :ref:`programming languages <imu_brick_programming_interface>`,
allows access to the calculated data and also the acceleration, magnetic field 
and angular velocity of the three axes. If the quaternion representation is 
used, the IMU Brick does not have a 
`gimbal lock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock>`__,
as known from Euler angles.

Two :ref:`Bricklet <primer_bricklets>` ports can be used to extend the 
features of this Brick. For Example a :ref:`GPS Bricklet <gps_bricklet>` can be
attached to get position information. 
A 
`Youtube video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaqtzG7lyp0>`__ shows, how the 
Brick can be used together with a :ref:`Barometer Bricklet <barometer_bricklet>` 
to gain altitude information.

The IMU Brick can be use together with other Bricks in a 
:ref:`stack <primer_stack>`. For example an additional 
:ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>` with
:ref:`Master Extension <primer_master_extensions>` allows to replace the USB 
connection by other cable based (:ref:`RS485 <rs485_extension>`, 
:ref:`Ethernet <ethernet_extension>`) or wireless (:ref:`WIFI <wifi_extension>`) 
connections.

Connectivity

The following picture depicts the different connection possibilities of the
IMU Brick.

You can see all of the available data form the IMU Brick. If you hold the
IMU Brick in the orientation as shown in the image and press
"Save Orientation", the movements that you make with the IMU Brick should be
mirrored in the Brick Viewer. Before you press "Save Orientation" you should
hold the IMU Brick still for about 15 seconds, so it can converge to the
correct position.

IMU Calibration
---------------

The IMU Brick comes factory calibrated and should work out of the box. It is
however easy to recalibrate, if necessary.

The factory calibration has taken place in a room without any significant
interfering magnetic fields. If you want to operate the IMU Brick near something
that has a magnetic field (e.g. near a motor), you will have to recalibrate
the magnetometer in the exact position where it will be used later on!

To calibrate the magnetometer press on "Calibrate" in the Brick Viewer and
choose the "Magnetometer" tab of the new window. Press "Start Calibration"
and now change the orientation of the IMU Brick until the bias and gain values
shown in the GUI do not change anymore. Press "Ready" when this is the case
and you are done.

Accelerometer and gyroscope can be calibrated similarly, follow the
instructions as given by the calibration tool. We recommend that you
export the calibration before you start recalibrating the accelerometer
and the gyroscope, so you are able to go back to the old calibration.

We recommend that you don't try to recalibrate the gyroscope gain, it is not
possible without suitable external machinery.

The factory calibration for your IMU Brick can be found at::

 http://download.tinkerforge.com/imu_calibration/YOUR_IMU_UID.txt

Replace ``YOUR_IMU_UID`` by the UID of your IMU Brick.
If you accidentally miscalibrated a sensor or you
flashed a new firmware version, you can reimport the factory calibration.
To do so go to the "IMU Brick" in the Brick Viewer, click the "Calibrate"
button and select the "Im/Export" tab. Finally copy and paste the content of
``YOUR_IMU_UID.txt`` to the textbox and click "Import".

Since Brick Viewer version 1.1.13 you can also click the "Restore Factory
Calibration" button, that automatically downloads and imports the factory
calibration for you.

A video how we calibrate the IMU Bricks can be found:
`here <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JckgemCHvCA>`__.


Quaternions vs Euler Angles
---------------------------

We highly recommend that you use
`quaternions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation>`__
in your project rather than Euler angles (`yaw, pitch and roll
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaw,_pitch,_and_roll>`__), since the latter
exhibits a `gimbal lock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock>`__.

A formula to transform quaternions to rotation matrices can be found in the
API documentation. Note that Euler angles always have an order in which they
are applied. The order for the IMU Brick is: roll, yaw, pitch.


Computation of independent Angles
---------------------------------

It is not possible to get angles for all 3 axis that are completely independent.
At least at the gimbal lock positions there will be jumps of 180째 for
some of the angles. This is simply not possible otherwise.

If you want rotation angles for the x, y and z axis for a given base
position, you have to rotate the quaternion according to your base
position and calculate the angles after that. The following Python example
does exactly that and it should be easy to understand and translate in other
languages. Note that there are gimbal locks at +90째 and -90째 from each of the
angles. The base position will be (0,0,0):

Paul Balzer from MechLab Engineering has additional `code on GitHub
<https://github.com/MechLabEngineering/TinkerforgeAttitude>`__ that uses the
quaternions to calculate yaw, pitch and roll in a vehicle coordinate system according
to DIN70000. It is notably consistently a right-handed coordinate system.

How it works
------------

With the sensor data gathered by the IMU Brick (angular velocity, acceleration and
magnetic field), it is possible to apply sensor fusion to acquire an absolute
orientation.

For this process often a
`Kalman Filter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter>`__ is used.
The filter that is used in the IMU Brick is based on
`this paper <http://www.x-io.co.uk/res/doc/madgwick_internal_report.pdf>`__
by `S. O. Madgwick <http://www.x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/>`__.
In our tests this new state of the art filter
could achieve significantly better results than a Kalman Filter. Madgwick
describes the approach of his filter as follows:

 [...] the filter calculates the orientation by numerically integrating the
 estimated orientation rate. It is computed as the rate of change of
 orientation measured by the gyroscopes. The magnitude of the gyroscope
 measurement error is removed in the direction of the estimated error,
 which is computed from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements.

The following image shows the different steps of the filter:
