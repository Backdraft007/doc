Description
-----------

With the Silent Stepper :ref:`Brick <primer_bricks>` one bipolar
`stepper motor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor>`__
with a maximum current of **1.6A** and a maximum voltage of **46V** per phase
can be controlled over **USB**.  With the provided API for many 
:ref:`programming languages <stepper_brick_programming_interface>` you can 
control the direction, velocity and acceleration of the connected motor.
Step modes of the motor can be chosen between full-step and 1/256-steps.

Two :ref:`Bricklet <primer_bricklets>` ports can be used to extend the 
features of this Brick. It can also be used together with other Bricks in a
:ref:`stack <primer_stack>`. For example an additional 
:ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>` with
:ref:`Master Extension <primer_master_extensions>` allows
to replace the USB connection by other cable based 
(:ref:`RS485 <rs485_extension>`, :ref:`Ethernet <ethernet_extension>`) 
or wireless (:ref:`WIFI <wifi_v2_extension>`) connections.

The stepper motor can be powered by an external power supply connected
directly to the Brick (black connector) or by the stack internal power supply.
If an external power supply is connected the Brick automatically switches to 
this power supply.

It is possible to run the Silent Stepper Brick in a variety of different modes.
The stepper motor can be driven completely noiseless (Stealth Mode), with
smart energy optimizations (Coolstep Mode) or with maximized torque 
(Classic mode). The Silent Stepper Brick can be configured to switch between 
these modes automatically dependent on motor velocity.

Connectivity
------------

The following picture depicts the different connection possibilities of the
Stepper Brick.

Test your Silent Stepper Brick
------------------------------

|test_intro|

Connect a stepper motor to the Brick and a suitable power supply
(see :ref:`here <stepper_brick_connectivity>`). Your setup should look
like below.

In the left part of the GUI you can enable the driver and control
the velocity, acceleration and deceleration of the stepper. Below
there are three buttons that control the direction of
the stepper and stop it. For example if you press "Forward",
the stepper will increase its speed to "Max Velocity" with the given
acceleration. If you press "Stop" it will decrease its speed to "0" with
the given deceleration.

Below you can set the stepping modes (full- to 1/256-step)
and trigger a "Full Brake", which stops the motor immediately.

You can drive to a specific position (measured in steps)
by entering it at "Drive To" an press "Go". Also you can drive a
specific number of steps. By using these controls the motor will accelerate
until reaching the maximum velocity and decelerate before reaching the
specified position.

On the right side the current position and remaining steps are shown
as well as the stack voltage and the voltage of the external power-connector (black).
Below is a graphical representation of the velocity of the stepper.
Beneath you can configure the minimum input voltage, which allows for
undervoltage signals if the voltage is too low. In the bottom right the
motor current can be configured according to the connected motor.

At the very bottom all of the Basic, Stealth, Coolstep, Spreadcycle and Misc
configurations can be set. The last tab shows the current status of the
driver.

Power Supply
------------

The connected stepper motor can be powered through the black on-board power-connector
or through a :ref:`Power Supply <primer_power_supplies>` in the
stack. The Brick switches automatically to the on-board power-connector when
a voltage is measured there and no external voltage is detected on the power-connector.
The black power connector is always prioritized.


Error LED
---------

The red LED is enabled if the input voltage is below the user
configurable minimum voltage.


Modes and their Features
------------------------

Basic Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most applications you can keep all of the settings as default and only
configure the basic configuration:

* **Standstill Current**: This value can be used to lower the current during stand still. This might
  be reasonable to reduce the heating of the motor and the Brick. When the motor is in standstill 
  the configured motor phase current will be driven until the configured 
  Power Down Time is elapsed. After that the phase current will be reduced to the standstill 
  current. The elapsed time for this reduction can be configured with the Standstill Delay Time.
  The unit is in mA and the maximum allowed value is the configured maximum motor current.

* **Motor Run Current**: The value sets the motor current when the motor is running. 
  Use a value of at least one half of the global maximum motor current for a good 
  microstep performance. The unit is in mA and the maximum allowed value is the current 
  motor current. The API maps the entered value to 1/32 ... 32/32 of the maximum
  motor current. This value should be used to change the motor current during motor movement,
  whereas the global maximum motor current should not be changed while the motor is moving.

* **Standstill Delay Time**: Controls the duration for motor power down after a motion 
  as soon as standstill is detected and the Power Down Time is expired. A high Standstill Delay
  Time results in a smooth transition that avoids motor jerk during power down.
  The value range is 0 to 307ms

* **Power Down Time**: Sets the delay time after a stand still. 
  The value range is 0 to 5222ms.

* **Stealth Threshold**: Sets the *upper threshold* for stealth mode in steps/s. The value range is
  0-65536 steps/s. If the velocity of the motor goes above this value, stealth mode is turned
  off. Otherwise it is turned on. In stealth mode the torque declines with high speed.

* **Coolstep Threshold**: Sets the *lower threshold* for Coolstep mode in steps/s. The value range is
  0-65536 steps/s. The Coolstep Threshold needs to be above the Stealth Threshold.

* **Classic Threshold**: Sets the *lower threshold* for Classic mode. The value range is
  0-65536 steps/s. In classic mode the stepper becomes more noisy, but the torque is maximized.

* **High Velocity Shopper Mode**: If High Velocity Shopper Mode is enabled, the stepper control
  is optimized to run the stepper motors at high velocities.


Stealth Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In stealth mode the stepper motor is driven quietly and with little vibrations.
The mode is usable for low and medium velocities.

Coolstep Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Coolstep mode the stepper motor is driven with smart energy optimizations.
In applications with varying loads, the power consumption is automatically
reduced during low load times. This means that less heat is generated and
less cooling is necessary.

Classic Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Classic mode Stealth and Coolstep are disabled. The stepper motor is driven
without any of the advanced features, but in return the torque is maximized.

Spreadcycle
^^^^^^^^^^^

Spreadcycle is a cycle-by-cycle current control. It has a fast reaction time
to changes in velocity and motor load. It can be used together with Coolstep
mode.

Stallguard
^^^^^^^^^^

Stallguard can be used to measure motor load and for stall
detection. In Coolstep mode the measurement is used internally to adjust the
motor current to the load.


Help! I don't understand half of the words
------------------------------------------

The used TMC2130 is a powerful stepper motor driver. Unfortunately this comes with
lots of modes, features and configuration possibilities. In our experience,
you can leave all of the configurations but the Basic Configurations 
(first tab in Brick Viewer) as default. We did choose sane default values for
all of the configurations.

If you want to understand all of the features in detail and the description in
this documentation is not enough, you can take a look at the
`TMC2130 datasheet <https://github.com/Tinkerforge/silent-stepper-brick/raw/master/datasheets/TMC2130_datasheet.pdf>`__.

For convenience, we provide a table that shows which API function parameters
changes what TMC2130 register.
