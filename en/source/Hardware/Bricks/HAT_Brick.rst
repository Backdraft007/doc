.. _hat_brick_test:

Test your HAT Brick
-------------------

To get started with the HAT Brick you first have to install :ref:`Brick Daemon <brickd>`
on the Raspberry Pi. Brick Daemon acts as a proxy between the Bricklet ports
on the HAT and the API bindings.

You can install Brick Daemon from the terminal with the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libudev0 pm-utils
	wget http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickd/linux/brickd_linux_latest_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i brickd_linux_latest_armhf.deb

After you have the Brick Daemon installed you can put the HAT on top of the
Raspberry Pi and restart it.

Now use :ref:`Brick Viewer <brickv>` to connect to the Bricklets. You can install
Brick Viewer directly on the Raspberry Pi or on an external PC that has access to
the Raspberry Pi (over Ethernet or WIFI). If you use an external PC you have to
connect to the IP of the Raspberry Pi, otherwise to localhost.

In the Brick Viewer a new tab named "HAT Brick" as well as one Tab for each of the
connected Bricklets will appear:

..
	.. image:: /Images/Bricks/brick_hat_brickv.jpg
	   :scale: 100 %
	   :alt: HAT Brick in Brick Viewer
	   :align: center
	   :target: ../../_images/Bricks/brick_hat_brickv.jpg

In the HAT Brick tab of the Brick Viewer you can test the sleep mode and see the
measured voltages as well as the connected Bricklets.

If you are not sure if the HAT Brick was detected correctly you can take a look
in the folder ``/proc/device-tree/hat/`` on the Raspberry Pi:

.. code-block:: shell

	cd /proc/device-tree/hat/
	echo Name: "$(tr -d '\0'<name)", Product: "$(tr -d '\0'<product)",  Product ID: "$(tr -d '\0'<product_id)", Vendor: "$(tr -d '\0'<vendor)"

This should print something like the following::

	Name: hat, Product: HAT Bricklet, Product ID: 0x084e, Vendor: Tinkerforge GmbH

If the folder does not exist or the data does not match the installation was not
successfull. Is the HAT Brick connected correctly? Did you restart the RPi after
you connected it?


.. _hat_brick_low_power_sleep_mode:

Low Power Sleep Mode
--------------------

The HAT Brick can turn the Raspberry Pi off and on again with a
configurable off-duration.

You can configure if the power supply off the Bricklets is to be
turned off at the same time. Addtionally the blue status LED can
be either turned off, or configured as a sleep indicator with a
1 second blink interval.

While the RPi is turned off, the real-time clock on the HAT will
still be running and set the correct time when the RPi boots
again.

For more details take a look at the ``SetSleepMode`` function in the
API.


.. _hat_brick_watchdog:

Watchdog
--------

The HAT Brick can be used as a watchdog for the Raspberry Pi. It
can restart the Raspberry Pi if it crashes or gets stuck.

To implement the watchdog you can also use the sleep delay and
sleep duration parameters of the ``SetSleepMode`` function.

Watchdog implementation example (Python):

.. code-block:: python

	while True:
		hat.set_sleep_mode(10, 2, True, False, False)
		time.sleep(1)

This will tell the HAT Brick to restart the Raspberry Pi in 10 seconds in
a 1 second loop. The 10 second delay will be reset every loop-iteration. If
the Raspberry Pi crashes, the loop doesn't run anymore and the HAT Brick will
restart the Raspberry Pi.

This loop can be a standalone program or you can put the ``SetSleepMode``
call somewhere in the main loop of your application that runs on the
Raspberry Pi. In this case the Raspberry Pi is automatically restartet
if the application crahses or gets stuck.


.. _hat_brick_real_time_clock:

Real-Time Clock
---------------

The HAT Brick comes with a I2C real-time clock that is directly connected to
the Raspberry Pi. It will be automatically detected by the RPi. You can check
if it was detected with dmesg. It should have an entry that looks like::

	[    3.850299] rtc-pcf8523 1-0068: rtc core: registered rtc-pcf8523 as rtc0

If you don't have NTP available you have to initially set the real-time clock.
To do this you can set the correct date/time on the Raspberry Pi by hand
and then call

.. code-block:: shell

	hwclock --systohc

on the Raspberry Pi. This will transfer the current time set on the Raspberry Pi
to the real-time clock. You only have to do this once.

If you have NTP available the real-time clock will be updated automatically.

If you have Brick Daemon installed, it will make sure that the real-time
clock date/time is automatically transferred back to the system on the next
reboot.

Without the Brick Daemon you can also do this by yourself by calling

.. code-block:: shell

	hwclock --hctosys
