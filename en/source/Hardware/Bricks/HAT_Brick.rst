.. _hat_brick_description:

Description
-----------

The HAT Brick is a `Raspberry Pi HAT <https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-raspberry-pi-hats/>`__
with the standard Raspberry Pi HAT form factor. The Brick follows the HAT specification
and will automatically and without any changes work with Raspbian.

With the HAT Brick you can connect up to **eight** :ref:`Bricklets <primer_bricklets>` to your
Raspberry Pi.

.. note::
  The HAT Brick provides Bricklet ports with 7 poles each. You can connect Bricklets with a
  7 pole to 7 pole cable to it. Only Bricklets with 7 pole Bricklet ports are 
  supported.

You can power the Raspberry Pi through the HAT Brick by an external 5V-28V DC power supply. 
The onboard power supply will be able to provide stable 5V, even under heavy load. You
can power the Raspberry Pi, connected Bricklets and USB devices connected to the 
Raspberry Pi's USB connectors as the HAT Brick delivers a slightly increased voltage of 5.3V
to compensate additional load.

You can still power the
HAT/Raspberry Pi through Micro-USB. In that case you have to ensure that the HAT Brick will be provided with stable 5V, 
for example by using the official Raspberry Pi universal power supply.
The USB/DC supply voltages are measured and accessible through the API.

The HAT Brick has a :ref:`real-time clock with battery backup <hat_brick_real_time_clock>`
that is directly connected to the Raspberry Pi. It can :ref:`turn the Raspberry Pi off for a specified time <hat_brick_low_power_sleep_mode>`.
Therefore you can use the Raspberry Pi in battery powered
applications, for example to send sensor information every hour to a cloud.

A :ref:`watchdog <hat_brick_watchdog>` can also be implemented with the HAT, so that the Raspberry Pi will be
restarted if it crashes or your program gets stuck.

The HAT Brick is electrically compatible to the Raspberry Pi 2B, 3B, 3B+, 4B, Zero and Zero W. The mounting
holes are compatible to the Raspberry Pi 2/3/4. We also offer a smaller :ref:`HAT Zero Brick <hat_zero_brick>`
that has mounting holes which are compatible to the Raspberry Pi Zero.

.. _hat_brick_getting_started:

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the HAT Brick, you first have to install :ref:`Brick Daemon <brickd>`
on the Raspberry Pi. Brick Daemon acts as a proxy between the Bricklet ports
on the HAT Brick and the API bindings. It also handles the real-time clock.

You can install Brick Daemon from the Raspberry Pi's terminal with the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libudev0 pm-utils
	wget http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickd/linux/brickd_linux_latest_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i brickd_linux_latest_armhf.deb

After Brick Daemon is installed you can put the HAT Brick on top of the
Raspberry Pi and restart it.

Now use :ref:`Brick Viewer <brickv>` to connect to the HAT Brick and connected Bricklets. 
You can install Brick Viewer directly on the Raspberry Pi or on an external PC that has 
access to it over Ethernet or WIFI. If you use an external PC you have 
to connect to the hostname or IP of the Raspberry Pi, otherwise to localhost.

In Brick Viewer a new tab named "HAT Brick" as well as one tab for each of the
connected Bricklets will appear:

.. image:: /Images/Bricks/brick_hat_brickv.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: HAT Brick in Brick Viewer
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Bricks/brick_hat_brickv.jpg

In the HAT Brick tab of Brick Viewer you can test the sleep mode and see the
measured voltages as well as the connected Bricklets.

If you are not sure if the HAT Brick was detected correctly you can take a look
in the folder ``/proc/device-tree/hat/`` on the Raspberry Pi:

.. code-block:: shell

	cd /proc/device-tree/hat/
	echo Name: "$(tr -d '\0'<name)", Product: "$(tr -d '\0'<product)",  Product ID: "$(tr -d '\0'<product_id)", Vendor: "$(tr -d '\0'<vendor)"

This should print something like the following::

	Name: hat, Product: HAT Brick, Product ID: 0x084e, Vendor: Tinkerforge GmbH

If the folder does not exist or the data does not match the installation was not
successful. Is the HAT Brick connected correctly? Did you restart the Raspberry Pi after
plugging in the HAT Brick?


.. _hat_brick_low_power_sleep_mode:

Low Power Sleep Mode
--------------------

The HAT Brick can turn the Raspberry Pi off and on again with a
configurable off-duration.

You can configure if the power supply of the Bricklets is to be
turned off at the same time. Addtionally the blue status LED can
be either turned off, or configured as a sleep indicator with a
1 second blink interval.

While the Raspberry Pi is turned off, the real-time clock on the HAT Brick will
still be running and set the correct time when the Raspberry Pi boots
again.

For more details take a look at the ``SetSleepMode`` function in the
API.


.. _hat_brick_watchdog:

Watchdog
--------

The HAT Brick can be used as a watchdog for the Raspberry Pi. It
can restart the Raspberry Pi if it crashes or gets stuck.

To implement the watchdog you can also use the ``sleep delay`` and
``sleep duration`` parameters of the ``SetSleepMode`` function, as shown in the following python example:

.. code-block:: python

	while True:
		hat.set_sleep_mode(10, 2, True, False, False)
		time.sleep(1)

This will tell the HAT Brick to restart the Raspberry Pi in 10 seconds in
a 1 second loop. The 10 second delay will be reset every loop iteration. If
the Raspberry Pi crashes, the loop will stop running and the HAT Brick will
restart the Raspberry Pi after 10 seconds have passed.

This loop can be a standalone program or you can put the ``SetSleepMode``
call in the main loop of your application that runs on the
Raspberry Pi. In this case the Raspberry Pi is automatically restarted
if the application crashes or gets stuck.


.. _hat_brick_real_time_clock:

Real-Time Clock
---------------

The HAT Brick comes with a I2C real-time clock that is directly connected to
the Raspberry Pi. It will be automatically detected by the Raspberry Pi. You can check
if it was detected with ``dmesg``. It should have an entry that looks like::

	[    3.850299] rtc-pcf8523 1-0068: rtc core: registered rtc-pcf8523 as rtc0

If you don't have NTP available, you have to initially set the real-time clock.
To do this you can set the correct date/time on the Raspberry Pi by hand
and then call

.. code-block:: shell

	hwclock --systohc

on the Raspberry Pi. This will transfer the current time set on the Raspberry Pi
to the real-time clock. You only have to do this once.

If you have NTP available, the real-time clock will be updated automatically.

If you have Brick Daemon installed, it will make sure that the real-time
clock date and time are automatically transferred back to the system on the next
reboot.

Without the Brick Daemon you can also do this yourself by calling

.. code-block:: shell

	hwclock --hctosys


Compatibility to other Boards and Images
----------------------------------------

If you use Raspbian, the HAT Brick will automatically be detected and usable. The pins
that are used for the communication with the Bricklets are configured automatically.

This is done through a configuration that is read by Raspian from an EEPROM on the HAT.

If you use a non-standard linux image that does not have the ``raspi-config`` framework or
a different board that has a compatible pin header but a different processor this will
not work automatically.

In this case the Brick Daemon can do the necessary configuration to the SPI and GPIO 
pins. You have to add the configuration to the ``/etc/brickd.conf`` file.

For a standard Raspberry Pi you can add the following::

	bricklet.group0.spidev = /dev/spidev0.0

	bricklet.group0.cs0.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs0.name = gpio23
	bricklet.group0.cs0.num = 23

	bricklet.group0.cs1.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs1.name = gpio22
	bricklet.group0.cs1.num = 22

	bricklet.group0.cs2.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs2.name = gpio25
	bricklet.group0.cs2.num = 25

	bricklet.group0.cs3.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs3.name = gpio26
	bricklet.group0.cs3.num = 26

	bricklet.group0.cs4.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs4.name = gpio27
	bricklet.group0.cs4.num = 27

	bricklet.group0.cs5.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs5.name = gpio24
	bricklet.group0.cs5.num = 24

	bricklet.group0.cs6.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs6.name = gpio7
	bricklet.group0.cs6.num = 7

	bricklet.group0.cs7.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs7.name = gpio6
	bricklet.group0.cs7.num = 6

	bricklet.group0.cs8.driver = gpio
	bricklet.group0.cs8.name = gpio5
	bricklet.group0.cs8.num = 5

First you have to define the spi device that is used (``/dev/spidev0.0`` for the
Raspberry Pi). Then you have to define the GPIO driver, name and number for each
chip select pin. There are eight chip selects for the eight Bricklet ports and one 
additional chip select for the HAT Brick itself.

If you use a completely different board you will have to take a look at it's
schematics  to adjust the configuration. If you need help with this
the best place to ask is probably in the forums at 
`tinkerunity.org <https://www.tinkerunity.org>`__.
