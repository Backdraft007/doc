Hardware Hacking for Beginners
==============================

Hardware hacking with Starter Kit: Hardware Hacking is easy, etc etc!

Soldering a wire to a solder pad
--------------------------------

To solder a wire to a pad, you need a 
`soldering iron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering_iron>`__ 
and `solder <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder>`__.

Don't be afraid if you have never soldered something! You only
need to solder a wires to a solder pad if you want to hack
hardware with the Starter Kit: Hardware Hacking.

You can solder a wire to a pad in five steps:

* Heat the solder pad with the soldering iron
* Add solder to the pad while it is hot
* Attach the cable to the pad
* Remove the soldering iron (still hold the cable to the pad)
* Wait until pad is cooled down 

To make it easier, you can also apply some solder to the
stripped part of the cable first.

We also made a small video to show the process:
