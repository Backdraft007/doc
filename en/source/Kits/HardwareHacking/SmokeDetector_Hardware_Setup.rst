Smoke Detector Hardware Setup
=============================

Typically a smoke Detector is equipped with one or more LEDs which signal the 
state. The number and behaviour of the LEDs will depend on the used model.

In this example we use an `ELRO FA20RF/2

smoke detector. It is equipped with two different LEDs. One lights up during 
alarm red it is a combined green/red LED. 

Take a look at the Smoke Detector
---------------------------------

After locating the right LED we have to open the casing of the detector.
In our case it looks like the following:
