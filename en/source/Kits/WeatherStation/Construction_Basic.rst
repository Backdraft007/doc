Construction: Basic Weather Station
===================================

The basic Weather Station Kit comes with :ref:`Ambient Light
<ambient_light_bricklet>`, :ref:`Barometer <barometer_bricklet>`,
:ref:`Humidity <humidity_bricklet>` and :ref:`LCD 20x4 Bricklet
<lcd_20x4_bricklet>`, :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>`, the Weather Station
case including a replacement side element for a :ref:`DC Jack Adapter
<dc_jack_adapter>`, Bricklet cables and USB cable as well as lots of screws,
spacers, nuts and washers.

There are several ways to mount the Bricks and Bricklets in the
case. In this construction tutorial we will show one way to
put everything together.

For easy understanding there are some sketches in the following.
Bricks and Bricklets could be mounted in two ways:

* If a Brick or Bricklet is mounted on the **front** side of a case part, the
  Brick or Bricklet is shown in normal colors
* If a Brick or Bricklet is mounted on the **back** side of a case part, the
  Brick or Bricklet is shown in **blue**

Remove Protective Foils
-----------------------

At first the protective foils on all case parts have to be removed.
There is one foil on the front- and backside each. In some cases the protective
foils can be hard to remove and it seems that there is no foil at all.

Master Brick on Backside
------------------------

In the next step the Master Brick has to be screwed on the backside part:

* **4x:** Screw one 10mm spacer with a 5mm screw on the backside part
* Mount the Master Brick with four 5mm screws, the USB port should be oriented
  to the right side

Ambient Light Bricklet on Topside
---------------------------------

At the next step the Ambient Light Bricklet has to be attached to the topside
part of the case. To make sure that it picks up as little light as possible
from the LCD backlight, it is screwed directly to the topside of the case:

* **4x:** Put a 12mm screw from the outside through the case part and screw
  a washer and a nut from the other side against it
* Screw the Ambient Light Bricklet, as depicted on the following image,
  with four nuts

If everything went as expected the Bricklet connector should have about 
1mm space to the topside part. This way it is still easy to connect the 
Bricklet cable, and the sensor is at a good position to give useful 
measurements.

Alternative: In case of the black weather station, the Ambient Light Bricklet is mounted
on top of the outside of the topside.

Humidity and Barometer Bricklet on Frontside
--------------------------------------------

Humidity and Barometer Bricklet will be attached directly to the front side part
of the case:

* **8x:** Screw a 10mm spacer with a 5mm screw to the **inside** on the 
  front side part
* Mount the Ambient Light Bricklet with 5mm screws to the spacers
* Mount the Humidity Bricklet with 5mm screws to the spacers
* Attach the Bricklet cable to the Bricklets

   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/weather_station_construction_front1_1200.jpg

This way there is enough space between the sensors and the case
to allow good measurements. If you intend
to attach something big on the bottom side, you can attach the Humidity and
Barometer Bricklets the same way as the Ambient Light Bricklet to save space.
The already attached Bricklet cables will make the installation of the LCD 
Bricklet in the next step more easy.

LCD 20x4 Bricklet on Frontside
------------------------------

Now we mount the LCD 20x4 Bricklet to the front side of the case:

* **4x:** Put a 12mm screw from the outside through the case part and screw
  a washer and a nut from the other side against it
* Put the LCD Display on the four screws such that the pin header is not next
  to the  cut-out of the front side part
* Fix the display with four 10mm spacers
* Attach the LCD 20x4 Bricklet to the display
* Fix it with four 5mm screws

At the end the buttons of the LCD Bricklet should be reachable through the
cut-out of the front side.

In this instruction the Bricklet cables are routed below the LCD 20x4 Bricklet,
but it is also possible to route them between the two circuit boards of the
LCD 20x4 Bricklet to hide them a little bit more.

Putting the Case together
-------------------------

In the last step the parts of the case are put together:

* Put the topside part in the backside part
* Connect the Ambient Light Bricklet with the Master Brick

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/weather_station_construction_top_to_back_1200.jpg

* Attach the side parts to the backside (1x left, 2x right)
* **4x:** Construct spacer consisting of one 12mm, two 9mm and one 10mm spacer
* **4x:** Mount these spacers on the backside part with 5mm screws

* Connect the remaining Bricklets to the Master Brick. This can be done by
  lying the back and the front part side by side

* Assemble front- and back side part and fix them with four 5mm screws

**That's it, we are done!**
