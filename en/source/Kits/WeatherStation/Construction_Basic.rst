Construction: Basic Weather Station
===================================

The basic Weather Station Kit comes with :ref:`Ambient Light
<ambient_light_bricklet>`, :ref:`Barometer <barometer_bricklet>`,
:ref:`Humidity <humidity_bricklet>` and :ref:`LCD 20x4 Bricklet
<lcd_20x4_bricklet>`, :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>`, the Weather Station
case including a replacement side element for a :ref:`DC Jack Adapter
<dc_jack_adapter>`, Bricklet cables and USB cable as well as lots of screws,
spacers, nuts and washers.

There are several ways to mount the Bricks and Bricklets in the
case. In this construction tutorial we will show one way to
put everything together.

At first we will remove the protective foil on all casing parts.
There is one foil on the front- and backside each.

Master Brick on Backside
------------------------

After that we will start by screwing the Master Brick on the backside. We use
screws from the top and bottom with 10mm spacers at the bottom inside
of the case. The USB connector of the Master Brick faces to the outside.

Ambient Light Bricklet on Topside
---------------------------------

In the next step we attach the Ambient Light Bricklet to the topside
of the case. To make sure that it picks up as little light as possible
from the LCD backlight, we screw it directly to the topside of the case.
It is screwed to the inside with the sensor facing to the outside
through the case. We use a nut at the bottom and a nut as well as washer at
the top to get the correct height. The long 12mm screws are screwed in from
the top.

If everything went as expected, the screws should be flush at the
bottom and the Bricklet connector should have about 1mm space to the top.
This way it is still easy to connect the Bricklet cable, and the sensor is
at a good position to give useful measurements.

Humidity and Barometer Bricklet on Frontside
--------------------------------------------

Humidity and Barometer Bricklet will be attached to the frontside of the case.
We screw them to the inside with the sensors facing to the outside. For that
we use the 10mm spacers and screws from the inside as well as the outside.

This way there is enough space between the sensors and the case
to again allow good measurements. If you intend
to attach something big on the bottomside, you can attach the Humidity and
Barometer Bricklets the same way as the Ambient Light Bricklet to save space.

At this point you should already attach the Bricklet cables, otherwise it will
become fiddly after the LCD Bricklet is inserted.

LCD 20x4 Bricklet on Frontside
------------------------------

Now we mount the LCD 20x4 Bricklet to the case. It is probably easiest to
start by screwing the 10mm spacer to the black Bricklet board from the bottom.
After that we put the LCD on it and add a nut and washer between
the case and the LCD circuit board, to get a
nice distance between the board and the case. The whole thing is then screwed
together from the top with the long 12mm screws.

In this instruction we route the Bricklet cables below the LCD 20x4 Bricklet,
but it is also possible to route them between the two circuit boards of the
LCD 20x4 Bricklet to hide them a little bit more.

Putting the Sides together
--------------------------

We start putting the parts of the case together by attaching the
topside to the backside. We can then also attach the Bricklet cable
between the Master Brick and the Ambient Light Bricklet.

After that we attach all of the other side parts as well as the big spacers
that hold everything together. The big spacers should have a height of 40mm
and threads on both sides trough front- and backside.
We achieve this by screwing two 9mm, one 12mm and one 10mm spacer together.
This long spacer is then attached to the inside of the backside by a screw
from the outside of the backside.

Now only the Bricklet cables of the three other Bricklets have to be connected.
We can do this while the back and the front part are lying side by side.

After that we just have to put the frontside on the backside and add the four
missing screws. That's it, we are done!
