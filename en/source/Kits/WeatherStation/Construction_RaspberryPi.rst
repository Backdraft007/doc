Construction: Raspberry Pi Weather Station
==========================================

It is possible to control the Weather Station with an embedded board like
the Raspberry Pi. You can put the Raspberry Pi in the case, despite
it is a bit tricky to get everything in the case.

We will put a :ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>`,
a :ref:`Step-Down Power Supply <step_down_power_supply>`, a :ref:`DC Jack
Adapter <dc_jack_adapter>` and
the Rapsberry Pi in the case. The Raspberry Pi (and the Master Brick) will
be powered over the DC Jack Adapter by the Step-Down Power Supply.

How to mount the DC Jack Adapter in the case can be seen above
(:ref:`starter_kit_weather_station_construction_wifi`).

The Step-Down Power Supply (with Master Brick on top) is mounted on 10mm
spacers. We can put the SD card below the Step-Down Power Supply,
the Micro USB connector goes left from the Step-Down Power Supply
spacers. There are slots in the back side of the case that can be used
to hold the Raspberry Pi with cable ties.

The green 5V output of the Step-Down Power Supply is connected to the Micro
USB input of the Raspberry Pi to power it. The black connector of the
Step-Down Power Supply is connected to the DC Jack Adapter and
the Mini USB connector of the Master Brick is connected to the USB connector
of the Raspberry Pi by a small Mini USB cable.

From the back side we can see how the Raspberry Pi fits in.

The way the
Raspberry Pi is mounted in the images allows to easily connect an Ethernet
cable to the Raspberry Pi. You can also mount the Raspberry Pi the other
way around (turned 180Â°). Then you can use a smaller Mini USB cable, but
the Ethernet port is obstructed.

Another possible mounting option is to put the Raspberry Pi on the outside of
the back side of the case.
