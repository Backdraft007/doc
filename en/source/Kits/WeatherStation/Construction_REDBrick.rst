Construction: RED Brick Weather Station
=======================================

It is possible to control the Weather Station without any external
(Embedded-) PC by using a :ref:`RED Brick <red_brick>` mounted into the case.
In this tutorial we well use a `USB Power Supply
<https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/power-supplies/usb-power-supply.html>`__
to power the stack. It is also possible to power the stack with a
:ref:`Step-Down Power Supply <step_down_power_supply>` together with
a :ref:`DC Jack Adapter <dc_jack_adapter>` to power the stack. For details
about this see the :ref:`Wi-Fi Weather Station
<starter_kit_weather_station_construction_wifi>` construction section.

.. FIXME: recommend using a Step-Down Power Supply if a Wi-Fi stick should be used as well

The RED Brick Weather Station is an extension of the :ref:`basic version
<starter_kit_weather_station_construction_basic>`. You should build the basic
version first and then modify it as described down below.

Stack on Backside
-----------------

Just mount the stack consisting of RED Brick and Master Brick to the back side
of the case.

We can now mount the front of the case to the back again.
