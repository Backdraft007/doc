Construction of the Starter Kit: Server Room Monitoring
=======================================================

The Starter Kit: Server Room Monitoring comes with :ref:`Ambient Light
<ambient_light_bricklet>`, :ref:`PTC <ptc_bricklet>` and
:ref:`Temperature Bricklet<temperature_bricklet>`, 
:ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>`,
:ref:`Ethernet Master Extensions <ethernet_extension>` and
Bricklet cables as well as lots of screws, spacers, nuts and washers.

Remove Protective Foils
-----------------------

At first the protective foils on all case parts have to be removed.
There is one foil on the front and back side each. In some cases the protective
foils can be hard to remove and it seems that there is no foil at all.

Screw Brackets to Side Parts
----------------------------

In the next step we screw one bracket to one side part each. To do this you have
to put a nut in the dedicated slot of the bracket and put a screw through the 
side part and fix the bracket. If the nut does not seem to fit, rotate it a 
little bit in the slot until it fits.

The result is depicted in the following image:

Screw Side Parts to the Front Panel
-----------------------------------

Attach the previous manufactured side parts into the front panel and screw it to 
the front panel with the previous used nut technique. It will look as the 
following:

Screw Back Side to the Side Parts
---------------------------------

Next put the back side on the side parts and attach it as precious with nuts 
and screws. After that you have completed the build up of the rack enclosure.
In the next step we attach the Bricks and Bricklets to it.

Attach Bricks and Bricklets
---------------------------

The kit comes with a lot of mounting kits. There is one 9mm mounting kit 
included with 9mm spacers instead of 12mm spacers. Use these four 9mm spacers 
to put them between Master Brick and Ethernet Master Extension. Fix them with
nuts on the bottom side of the Ethernet Extension.

Screw this stack to one of the side parts by four screws. See below picture.

Next screw the PTC and the Temperature Bricklet to the backside
with four 10mm spacers and eight screws each.

Next connect the Bricklets with 15cm Bricklet cables to the Master Brick.
You can freely choose the port.

In the last step attach the Ambient Light Bricklet to the front panel.
To do this connect the 25cm Bricklet cable first to the Bricklet. After that
put four long screws through the frontpanel and fix them with one washer and one
nut each. Put the Bricklet on it and fix it with four additional nuts.
As the last step connect the Bricklet cable to the Master Brick

That was it! The finished work should look like the following:
