Construction of Starter Kit: Server Room Monitoring
===================================================

The Starter Kit: Server Room Monitoring comes with :ref:`Ambient Light
Bricklet <ambient_light_bricklet>`, :ref:`PTC Bricklet <ptc_bricklet>`,
:ref:`Temperature Bricklet<temperature_bricklet>`, 
:ref:`Humidity Bricklet<temperature_bricklet>`, 
:ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>`,
:ref:`Ethernet Extension <ethernet_extension>` and
Bricklet cables as well as lots of screws, spacers, nuts and washers.

Screws, spacers, nuts and washers are packed in mounting kits. These are
standardized kits and are not specially composed for this starter kit. Get
the necessary parts you need for each step from all mounting kits. The
remaining mounting parts can be used for your own modifications.

Remove Protective Foils
-----------------------

At first the protective foils on all case parts have to be removed.
There is a foil on the front and back side. In some cases the protective
foils may be hard to remove, you can use a cutter or similar as a
lever to get to the foil.

Screw Brackets to Side Parts
----------------------------

As the first construction step screw one bracket to one side part each. 
To do this you have to put a nut in the dedicated slot of the bracket,
put a 12mm long screw through the side part and fix the bracket. 
If the nut does not seem to fit, rotate it a little bit in the slot 
until it fits.

The result is depicted in the following image:

Screw Side Parts to the Front Panel
-----------------------------------

Attach the previously build side parts into the front panel and screw it to 
the front panel with the same nut technique. Attach the front panel as 
depicted in the following image (pay attention to the
position of the Ethernet Extension cut-out).

Screw Back Side to the Side Parts
---------------------------------

Next take twelve 10mm spacers (thread inside/inside) and short screws and
attach them to the position of the PTC, Temperature and Humidity Bricklet.

Put the back side on the side parts and attach it with nuts 
and screws. After that you have completed the build of the rack enclosure.
In the next step we attach the Bricks and Bricklets to it.

Attach Bricks and Bricklets
---------------------------

Now the Bricks and Bricklets will be attached to the case.

Master Brick and Ethernet Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use four 9mm spacers (thread inside/outside) 
and put them between Master Brick and Ethernet Extension (on top). 
Fix them with 10mm spacers (thread inside/inside) on the bottom side and with 
screws on the top side of the Ethernet Extension.

Screw this stack to one of the side parts by four screws.

PTC, Temperature and Humidity Bricklet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next attach the PTC Bricklet, the Temperature Bricklet and the Humidity Bricklet. 
Use four screws to mount them on the previously installed 
spacers on the back side part. 

You may want to attach the 15cm Bricklet cable before you mount the Bricklets
to the screws.

Before the first usage the PTC Bricklet has to be configured and the temperature
probe (2-wire) has to be attached. How this is done is documented
:ref:`here <ptc_bricklet_jumper_configuration>` and 
:ref:`here <ptc_bricklet_connectivity>`.

Ambient Light Bricklet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Attach the Ambient Light Bricklet to the front panel.
To do this connect the 50cm Bricklet cable to the Bricklet first. After that
put four 12mm long screws through the front panel and fix them with one washer 
and one nut each. Put the Bricklet on it and fix it with four additional nuts.

Connect Cables and Done
-----------------------

As the last step connect the Bricklet cables to the Master Brick and use a 
cable strap to fasten them.

That's it! The finished work should look as the following:
