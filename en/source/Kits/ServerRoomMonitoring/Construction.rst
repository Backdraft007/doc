Construction of the Starter Kit: Server Room Monitoring
=======================================================

The Starter Kit: Server Room Monitoring comes with :ref:`Ambient Light
Bricklet <ambient_light_bricklet>`, :ref:`PTC Bricklet <ptc_bricklet>`,
:ref:`Temperature Bricklet<temperature_bricklet>`, 
:ref:`Master Brick <master_brick>`,
:ref:`Ethernet Master Extension <ethernet_extension>` and
Bricklet cables as well as lots of screws, spacers, nuts and washers.

Screws, spacers, nuts and washers are packed in mounting kits. These are
standardized kits and are not specially composed for this starter kit. Get
the necessary parts you need for each step from all mounting kits. For your own
modifications there are more mounting parts included then necessary.

Remove Protective Foils
-----------------------

At first the protective foils on all case parts have to be removed.
There is foil on the front and back side. In some cases the protective
foils may be hard to remove, you can use a cutter or similar as a
lever to get to the foil.

Screw Brackets to Side Parts
----------------------------

In the next step we screw one bracket to one side part each. To do this you have
to put a nut in the dedicated slot of the bracket and put a 12mm long screw 
through the side part and fix the bracket. If the nut does not seem to fit, 
rotate it a little bit in the slot until it fits.

The result is depicted in the following image:

Screw Side Parts to the Front Panel
-----------------------------------

Attach the previous manufactured side parts into the front panel and screw it to 
the front panel with the previously used nut technique. It is important to 
attach the front panel as depicted in the following image (Pay attention to the
position of the Ethernet Master Extension cut-out ).

Screw Back Side to the Side Parts
---------------------------------

Next put eight 10mm spacers (thread inside/inside) and short screws and attach 
them to the position of the PTC and Temperature Bricklet.

At next put the back side on the side parts and attach it as previously with nuts 
and screws. After that you have completed the build of the rack enclosure.
In the next step we attach the Bricks and Bricklets to it.

Attach Bricks and Bricklets
---------------------------

Use four 9mm spacers (thread inside/outside) 
to put them between Master Brick and Ethernet Master Extension (on top). 
Fix them with 10mm spacers (thread inside/inside) on the bottom side and with 
screws on the top side of the Ethernet Extension.

Screw this stack to one of the side parts by four screws. See below picture.

Next attach a 15cm Bricklet cable to the PTC Bricklet and to the Temperature
Bricklet each. Use four screws each to mount it on the previous installed 
spacers on the back side part. The following image depicts the routing of the
cables.

Before the first usage the PTC Bricklet has to be configured and the temperature
probe (2-wire) has to be attached. How this is done is documented
:ref:`here <ptc_bricklet_jumper_configuration>` and 
:ref:`here <ptc_bricklet_connectivity>`.

In the last step attach the Ambient Light Bricklet to the front panel.
To do this connect the 50cm Bricklet cable to the Bricklet first. After that
put four 12mm long screws through the front panel and fix them with one washer 
and one nut each. Put the Bricklet on it and fix it with four additional nuts.
As the last step connect the Bricklet cable to the Master Brick and use a 
cable strap to fasten them.

That was it! The finished work should look like the following:
