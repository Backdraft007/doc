The Camera Slider consists of two main parts the frame and the cart. The
constructions starts at the two legs of the frame.

Legs
----

Each leg consists of three 60mm MakerBeams connected using two MakerBeam Corner
Brackets to form an upside down U-shape:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a MakerBeam Corner Bracket to the bolts with two lock nuts. Use another
  MakerBeam as temporary spacer in the corners of the brackets.

Repeat these steps four times two create a U-shaped leg. Then repeated all
steps for the second leg.

Stack Side
^^^^^^^^^^

One leg gets a stack mounting plate attached to it:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into each of the upright MakerBeams of the leg.
* Fasten the stack mounting plate to the leg with four lock nuts. Ensure that
  the plate does not overlap the crossbeam of the leg.

Idler Pulley Side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other leg gets bearings for the idler pulley attached to it. Start with the
bearings on the crossbeam of the leg:

* Place two bearings into a copper saddle band clip.
* Insert two 6mm bolts into the crossbeam of the leg.
* Fasten the bearing assembly to the middle of crossbeam with two lock nuts.

A second bearing assembly gets attached to a 60mm MakerBeam:

* Place two bearings into a copper saddle band clip.
* Insert two 6mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten the bearing assembly to the middle of the MakerBeam with two lock nuts.
* Insert a 6mm bolt into the MakerBeam on each side of the bearing assembly.

The MakerBeam-bearing assembly gets attached to the leg:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into each of the upright MakerBeams of the leg.
* Fasten the MakerBeam-bearing assembly to the upright MakerBeams using one
  MakerBeam L-Bracket and four lock nuts each.

Frame
-----

The two legs and two 900mm MakerBeams form the Frame:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into each of the upright MakerBeams of the stack leg
  opposite to the stack mounting plate.
* Fasten two MakerBeam Corner Brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each.
  Ensure that the brackets are flush with the top edge of the MakerBeam.
* Insert two 6mm bolts into each 900mm MakerBeam.
* Fit the MakerBeams into the corners of the leg and fasten them with two
  lock nuts each.

Next the stepper motor mounting plate gets attached to the frame:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into the topside of each 900mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten the stepper motor mounting plate to the leg with four lock nuts.

To complete the frame attach the idler pulley leg to the 900mm MakerBeams
the same way the stack leg got attached.

Cart
----

The cart rolls on top of the frame using 16 bearing.

Bearings
^^^^^^^^

The construction starts with attaching 16 bearing to four 60mm MakerBeams:

* Insert two 12mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam and fasten each one with a
  normal nut, not a lock nut. The bolts should be about 7mm from the edge of
  the Maker beam.
* Put a bearing onto each bolt and fasten it with a lock nut. Ensure that the
  bearing is near to the edge of the MakerBeam beam but does not overlap it.

Repeat these steps four times to create four MakerBeams with two bearings each.

Two of the four MakerBeams get two additional bearings each. Attach the
bearings at an 90Â° angle to the already attached ones the same way the first
two bearings got attached.

Add L-brackets to the 2-bearing assemblies:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into the MakerBeam opposite the bearings.
* Fasten two MakerBeam L-Brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each.

Add L-brackets to the 4-bearing assemblies:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into a bearing free side of the MakerBeam.
* Fasten two MakerBeam L-Brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each. Ensure
  that the L-bracket is facing away from the two adjacent bearings.

Base
^^^^

The base of the cart consists of the four bearing assemblies and two 150mm
MakerBeams:

* Insert four 6mm bolts into a 150mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a 4-bearing and a 2-bearing assembly to the bolts with two lock nuts
  each. Ensure that bearings on the side of the 4-bearing assembly faces the
  2-bearing assembly and that the L-brackets are facing away from each other.

These bearings will roll on top and on the sides of the frame.
