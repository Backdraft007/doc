The Camera Slider consists of two main parts, the frame and the cart. The
constructions starts with the legs of the frame.

Legs
----

Each pair of legs consists of three 60mm MakerBeams connected by two MakerBeam
Corner Brackets to form an upside down U-shape:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a MakerBeam Corner Bracket to the bolts with two lock nuts. Use another
  MakerBeam as temporary spacer in the corner of the bracket.

Repeat these steps four times two create a U-shaped pair of legs. Then repeat
all steps for the second pair of legs.

Frame
-----

The legs and two 900mm MakerBeams form the frame.

Stack Side
^^^^^^^^^^

Start with the stack-side legs:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into the upright MakerBeam of each stack-side leg
  opposite to the stack bracket.
* Fasten two MakerBeam Corner Brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each.
  Ensure that the brackets are flush with the top edge of the MakerBeam.
* Insert two 6mm bolts into each 900mm MakerBeam.
* Fit the MakerBeams into the corners of the pair of stack-side legs and fasten
  them with two lock nuts each.

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step14_1500.jpg

Cart
----

The cart rolls on top of the frame.

Bearing Assemblies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The construction starts with attaching twelve bearings to four 60mm MakerBeams.
These bearings will roll on top and on the sides of the frame:

* Insert two 12mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam and fasten each one with a
  normal nut, not a lock nut. The bolts should be about 7mm from the edge of
  the MakerBeam.
* Put a bearing onto each bolt and fasten it with a lock nut each. Ensure that
  the bearing is near to the edge of the MakerBeam beam but does not overlap it.

Repeat these steps four times to create four MakerBeams with two bearings each.

   :alt: MakerBeam with two bearings near to its edges
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step16_1500.jpg

Two of the four MakerBeams get two additional bearings each. Attach the
bearings at an 90Â° angle to the already attached ones, the same way the first
two bearings got attached.

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: MakerBeam with four bearings near to its edges
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step17_1500.jpg

Add L-brackets to the 2-bearing assemblies:

* Insert four 6mm bolts into the MakerBeam opposite to the bearings.
* Fasten two MakerBeam L-Brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each.

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step18_350.jpg

Add L-brackets to the 4-bearing assemblies:

* Insert four 6mm bolts into a bearing-free-side of the MakerBeam.
* Fasten two MakerBeam L-Brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each. Ensure
  that the L-brackets are facing away from the two adjacent bearings.

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step19_1500.jpg

The remaining four bearings are used to lock the cart onto the frame:

* Insert a 12mm bolt into a L-bracket and fasten it with a normal nut, not a
  lock nut.
* Put a bearing onto the bolt and fasten it with a lock nut.

Repeat these steps four times to create four L-bracket with a bearing each.

Substructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The substructure of the cart consists of the previous build four bearing 
assemblies and two 150mm MakerBeams:

* Insert four 6mm bolts into a 150mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a 4-bearing and a 2-bearing assembly to the bolts with two lock nuts
  each. Ensure that the bearings on the side of the 4-bearing assembly face the
  2-bearing assembly and that the L-brackets are facing away from each other.

Aligning the Bearings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The bearing assemblies have to be aligned to the frame before the cart
superstructure can be added:

* Loosen the sixteen lock nuts that fasten the bearing assemblies to the 150mm
  MakerBeams to allow sliding the bearing assemblies along the MakerBeams.
* Fit the 900mm MakerBeams of the frame between the bearings.
* Press each pair of bearing assemblies against the 900mm MakerBeams then
  fasten the loosened lock nuts again. Ensure that the 150mm MakerBeams
  overhang the frame equally on both sides.

Connecting Cart and Frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The remaining four 1-bearing assemblies are used to lock the cart onto the
frame:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into the bottom side of the cart.
* Add a washer to each bolt.
* Fasten a 1-bearing assembly to the bolts with two lock nuts.

Repeat these steps for each corner of the cart.

Superstructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The camera will be mounted on top of the cart superstructure. The
construction start with four corner posts:

* Insert four 6mm bolts into a 40mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten two L-brackets to the bolts with two lock nuts each.

Repeat these steps four times to create four corner posts.

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Cart superstructure corner post
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step30_1500.jpg

Attach the corner posts to the substructure:

* Insert two 6mm bolts in the side of the 150mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a corner post to the bolts with two lock nuts. Ensure that that post
  sits between the L-brackets of the substructure and that the L-brackets of
  the post are facing to the outside of the cart.

Repeat these steps for each corner post.

Timing Belt
-----------

In the final step of the construction the stepper motor and the timing belt are
added to the camera slider.

Pulleys
^^^^^^^

The drive pulley gets attached to the stepper motor:

* Put a pulley on the stepper motor shaft. Ensure that the part with the
  threaded holes faces away from the stepper motor and is flush with the end
  of the shaft.
* Fasten the pulley to the shaft with two set screws. Ensure that one set
  screw sits on the flat portion of the shaft.
* Fasten the stepper motor pulley-side down to the stepper motor bracket with
  four 6mm bolts.

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step33_350.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Bottom view of stepper motor with pulley
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step33_1500.jpg

The idler pulley on the other end of the frame uses a on long M3 bolt as shaft,
but the pulley has a 5mm hole. A brass shaft reducer reduces the hole to 3mm:

* Put the reducer into the pulley. This is a tight fit. Ensure that the
  set screws of the pulley are loose and that the reducer does not sit crooked.
  The fit might be so tight that the reducer does not seem to fit at all. In
  that case use pliers, a vice, a hammer or a similar tool to apply light force
  to press the reducer into the pulley.
* Fasten the two set screws.
* Install the modified pulley between the two bearing assemblies with a long
  M3 bolt. You might need to adjust the alignment of the bearings to make the
  bolt fit properly.

Clamps
^^^^^^

The timing belt clamp gets attached to a 60mm MakerBeam:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a L-bracket to each bolt with a lock nut.

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step37_350.jpg

   :alt: MakerBeam with two L-brackets
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step37_1500.jpg

While the cart substructure was built, four 12mm bolts with lock nuts were added
to the bottom side of the cart:

* Realign those 12mm bolts so that one bolt on each side of the cart sits in
  the middle of the cart.
* Realign the other two bolts so that the 60mm MakerBeam with the two
  L-brackets fits onto the four bolts. Ensure that the MakerBeam sits in the
  middle of the cart.

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step38_350.jpg

   :alt: Bottom view of realigned 12mm bolts
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step38_1500.jpg

Two L-brackets form a timing belt clamp:

* Connect two L-brackets using two 12mm bolts and two lock nuts.
* Put one end of the timing belt between the L-brackets and fasten it with the
  lock nuts. Ensure that the smooth side of the belt faces in the same
  direction as the lock nuts and that the L-brackets face in the direction of
  the belt end.

Repeat these steps for the other end of the timing belt.

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Timing belt clamp
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_camera_slider_step39_1500.jpg

Attach the clamps to the 60mm MakerBeam:

* Insert four 12mm bolts into the side of the 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten the clamps to the bolts with two lock nuts each, but do not fully
  tighten the second clamp to be able to adjust the belt length later. Ensure
  that the belt forms a loop with no twists and its smooth side facing
  outwards.
* Put the MakerBeam-clamp assembly back into the bottom of the cart onto the
  four 12mm bolts and loop the belt around the drive and the idler pulley.
  Ensure that the part with the threaded holes faces down on both pulleys.

After the timing belt is installed it has to be tensioned:

* Loosen the stepper motor bracket and move it to a position 1cm away from the
  end of the frame.
* Reduce the length of the timing belt loop to remove all slack.
* Fasten the second clamp that was left loose.
* Tension the timing belt by pushing the stepper motor bracket towards the
  end of the frame.
* Fasten the stepper motor bracket again.
