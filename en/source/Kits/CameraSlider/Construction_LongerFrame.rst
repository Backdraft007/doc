Construction - Extending the Frame
==================================

The :ref:`basic kit <starter_kit_camera_slider_construction_basic>` uses
two `900mm MakerBeams <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/beams/makerbeam-900mm-1-piece-black.html>`__
for the long rails of the frame. A simple way to extend the frame is to
replace the 900mm MakerBeams with `1500mm MakerBeams
<https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/beams/makerbeam-1500mm-1-piece-black.html>`__.
The timing belt in the basic kit is long enough for such an extended frame.

Extra Legs
----------

Depending on the load you want to put on the cart you might need an extra pair
of legs in the middle of the extended frame to support the weight. For one
extra pair of legs you need the following parts:

* 1x `MakerBeam 60mm, 8pcs, black <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/beams/makerbeam-60mm-8pcs-black.html>`__
* 1x `M3 Square Headed Bolts with Hex Hole, 6mm, 250pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/nuts-bolts/250-m3-square-headed-bolts-with-hex-hole-6mm.html>`__
* 1x `M3 Self Locking Nuts, 100pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/nuts-bolts/100-m3-self-locking-nuts.html>`__
* 1x `MakerBeam Corner Brackets, 12pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/brackets/makerbeam-corner-brackets-12pcs.html>`__
* 1x `MakerBeam L-Brackets, 12pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/brackets/makerbeam-l-brackets-12pcs.html>`__
* 1x `3D printed End Caps, 4pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/accessories/3d-printed-end-caps.html>`__

From the basic kit you should have enough 60mm MakerBeams, 6mm bolts and lock
nuts leftover. You should only need additional MakerBeam Corner Brackets and
L-Brackets.

This extra pair of legs is similar to the original legs of the frame but more
H-shaped. It consists of three 60mm MakerBeams connected by two MakerBeam
L-Brackets to form an H-shape that is connected to the frame with two MakerBeam
Corner Brackets. For the upright parts:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten a MakerBeam Corner Bracket to the bolts with two lock nuts.

Repeat these steps for the second upright part.

For the crossbeam:

* Insert four 6mm bolts into a 60mm MakerBeam.
* Fasten two MakerBeam L-Bracket to the bolts with two lock nuts each.

Connect the three MakerBeams to form an H-shape:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into each MakerBeam on the same side as the corner
  bracket.
* Fasten the crossbeam to the bolts using four lock nuts.

The cart has bearings that run on all four sides of the long MakerBeams. But
now with the extra pair of legs about to be connected to the middle of the
frame, the bearings that run on the bottom of the frame don't have a free path
anymore and have to be disconnected from the cart:

* Disconnect the four 1-bearings assemblies from the bottom of the cart.

Connect the extra pair of legs to the frame:

* Disconnect the stack-side pair of legs from the frame.
* Insert two 6mm bolts into the bottom side of each long MakerBeam.
* Reconnect the stack-side pair of legs to the frame.
* Fasten the extra pair of legs to the bolts using four lock nuts.

Extra Timing Belt
-----------------

Two 1500mm MakerBeams can be connected to form a 3m long frame with three
extra pairs of legs. For three extra pairs of legs you need the following
parts:

* 2x `MakerBeam 60mm, 8pcs, black <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/beams/makerbeam-60mm-8pcs-black.html>`__
* 1x `M3 Square Headed Bolts with Hex Hole, 6mm, 250pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/nuts-bolts/250-m3-square-headed-bolts-with-hex-hole-6mm.html>`__
* 1x `M3 Self Locking Nuts, 100pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/nuts-bolts/100-m3-self-locking-nuts.html>`__
* 1x `MakerBeam Corner Brackets, 12pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/brackets/makerbeam-corner-brackets-12pcs.html>`__
* 1x `MakerBeam L-Brackets, 12pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/brackets/makerbeam-l-brackets-12pcs.html>`__
* 2x `3D printed End Caps, 4pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/accessories/3d-printed-end-caps.html>`__

From the basic kit you should have four 60mm MakerBeams leftover. You should
only need one additional pack of 60mm MakerBeams and the other parts from the
list.

Finally, you need the 1500mm MakerBeams, straight brackets and an additional
timing belt:

* 4x `MakerBeam 1500mm, black <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/beams/makerbeam-1500mm-1-piece-black.html>`__
* 1x `MakerBeam Straight Brackets, 12pcs <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/makerbeam/brackets/makerbeam-straight-brackets-12pcs.html>`__
* 1x `Timing Belt with Pulleys <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/mounting/timing-belt-with-pulleys.html>`__

Two 1500mm MakerBeams get connected with a straight bracket:

* Insert two 6mm bolts into each 1500mm MakerBeam.
* Insert one 6mm bolt into the junction between the MakerBeams.
* Fasten a MakerBeam Straight Bracket to the bolts with five lock nuts.

Repeat these steps for the second pair of 1500mm MakerBeams.

Build three extra pairs of legs and connect one to the middle of each 1500mm
MakerBeam section and one beside their junction. Then replace the long
MakerBeams in the frame with this 3m long assembly.

Finally, the timing belt has to be extended:

* Disconnect one end of the timing belt from the cart.
* Staple the second timing belt to the loose end of the first one.
* Reconnect the 6m timing belt assembly to the cart.
* Tension the timing belt.
