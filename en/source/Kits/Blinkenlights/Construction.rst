Necessary Tools
---------------

You will need a phillips screwdriver, something to dismantle wires 
(knife or cable stripper), and a tape measure. Allow some extra time to build
the kit.


First Step
----------

Check if everything was delivered correctly. After that you can remove the 
protective foil of the front and back of the front panel (white) and the 
perforated board (black).

Attach Pixels to Perforated Board
---------------------------------

Next we will stick the pixels into the perforated board. It is  
important that you start with the correct pixel (begin with led pixel chain
input) on the correct position. If you start wrong it is possible that you can't
wire the pixels or that your cables will come out on the top position of the
display instead of the bottom side. 

The following image shows the back of the perforated board. The pixels
will be plugged in this side, such that the heads of the LEDs are on the front.
Notice the positions of the small mounting holes and the starting position.

Take the first bunch of pixels and insert the pixel with the 
plug (the end that will be connected to the LED Strip Bricklet).

Stick this pixel into the perforated board and place the next pixels as depicted
above.

If you finished to attach the first 50 pixels take the next pixels and plug
them together with their connectors. Then put the next 50 pixels into the 
perforated board and repeat this procedure.

Make Power Supply Cables and Dismantle Pixel Cables
---------------------------------------------------

In the next step we will cut and place the power supply cables. 5m of 2x2.5mm² 
wires are included in the kit. Cut the following wire lengths from it:

 * 1x 95cm
 * 1x 80cm
 * 1x 55cm
 * 1x 40cm
 * 1x 20cm
 * 1x 10cm

Dismantle 10mm of the wires on both ends.

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit Stripped Wires
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_wire_stripped_1200.jpg

Additionally dismantle 8mm on the power supply wires of the led pixels (blue and
red wires).


Connect the Wires
-----------------

We will start the wiring with the 95cm cable. It will connect the power supply to
the last connected led pixels. Take two 2-wire clamps and connect
one to the red led pixel wire and one on for the blue led pixel wire. The blue wire
will be connected with the black power supply wire. The red wire of the pixels
will be connected with the red wire of the power supply.
After that connect your 95cm cable and install it as depicted in the 
following picture.

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_build_step6_1200.jpg

After that we will wire the 80cm cable. It will be connected to the last but one
power supply point. Take two 3-wire clamps and connect the two blue wires of the
pixels with the black wire and the two red wires with the red wire. Install it
as depicted below.

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_build_step7_1200.jpg


Next we will wire the 55cm cable as before with two 3-wire clamps.

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit Construction Step with 55cm Cable

Repeat this step also for the 40cm cable.

   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_build_step9_1200.jpg


As the last wiring step take two 2-wire clamps and wire the first power supply 
point with the 20cm cable and install the cable as depicted:

   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit Construction Step with 20cm Cable
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_build_step10_1200.jpg


Prepare the 5V Power Supply
---------------------------

In this step we will make the wiring to power all these cables.
Connect the 5V power supply to two 5-wire clamps as depicted below.


.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_wago_power_350.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit Construction Power Supply Connection
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_wago_power_1200.jpg

The white wire of the power supply is the 5V wire and will later be connected to
the red wires. the black wire is GND and will be connected to the black wires.

Next take two additional 5-wire clamps and connect these clamps with the
previous 5-wire clamps.

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_wago_5x_1200.jpg

Connect everything
------------------

Next connect the previously installed power supply cables with the clamps.
Install it as depicted in the following picture:

Attach LED Strip Bricklet and Master Brick
------------------------------------------

After that we have to attach the LED Strip Bricklet and the Master Brick.
To do this start by dismantling the LED Strip Bricklet connection wires. 7mm 
will suffice. Connect it with the Bricklet and install everything as depicted
below

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_master_led_strip_1200.jpg

Connect this circuitry with the first pixel and install it as depicted below:

   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_build_step13_1200.jpg


Attach Mounting Plates
----------------------

In this step we will attach the mounting plates to the perforated board. Use
two 10mm spacers (thread inside/inside) and two M3 screws for each mounting plate:

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit mounting plate
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_holder_1200.jpg

After that mount these plates to the back of the perforated board with M3 
screws.

   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit mounting plate on board
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_holder_on_board_1200.jpg

After this step the board will look as the following:

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_on_wall_wo_frontpanel_350.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit on Wall without Front Panel
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_on_wall_wo_frontpanel_1200.jpg

The distance between the mounting holes is 32cm for both, vertical
and horizontal mounting.

Attach Front Panel (Optional)
-----------------------------

This step is optional. You can attach the front panel to the board,
dependend on your application you don't have to. The pixels without
front panel are **very bright**.

The following image is from the tetris exmaple without front panel:

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_tetris_wo_frontpanel_600.jpg

   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit Tetris w/o front panel
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_tetris_wo_frontpanel_1200.jpg

To mount the frount panel, add 12mm spacers (thread inside/outside) to
six positions

   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit Construction Front Panel Mounting
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_mounting_1200.jpg

and attach the front panel to them with screws:

.. image:: /Images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_on_wall_350.jpg
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: Blinkenlights Kit on Wall
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_images/Kits/kit_blinkenlights_on_wall_1200.jpg

If you want to use the kit to display pixel based things like text or games 
you can attach the front panel directly to the six 12mm spacers.
For diffuse applications like our fire example it is necessary to increase the
distance between front panel and the pixels. To do this simply put more spacers
between them. In our examples we used two 9mm spacers and one 12mm spacer 
additionally to the mounted 12mm spacer on each of the six mounting points.

Below you can see the rainbow example with 12mm spacer in daylight, 
with 2x12mm + 2x9mm spacer in daylight and with 2x12mm + 2x9mm spacer in
darkness:
