    .. rubric:: NetIO Controller App

    `NetIO <http://netio.davideickhoff.de/>`__ is a multi platform smart phone
    application, a generic remote controller for almost everything. It simply
    sends and reads strings over a network connection. The communication is not
    fixed to a specific protocol is, this allows to interact with many
    different devices. It can easily communicate with microcontrollers or PCs
    connected to a LAN! An online editor allows to configure the layout and
    functions of the control elements to realize different tasks.

    This :ref:`setup guide <netio_setup>` explains how to use NetIO to control
    Tinkerforge hardware.
