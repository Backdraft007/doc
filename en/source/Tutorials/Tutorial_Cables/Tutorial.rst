Tutorial - Bricklet Cables 
==========================

:ref:`Bricklets <primer_bricklets>` are connected by a cable to :ref:`Bricks <primer_bricks>`.
The current Tinkerforge system is using 7-pole connectors for Bricks and Bricklets, such that
a 7-pole to 7-pole cable is used.

The cables are available in different lengths:

* `Bricklet Cable 15cm (7p-7p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-15cm-7p-7p.html>`__

Cable for older Bricks/Bricklets
--------------------------------

Early 2017 we started to replace all of the existing Bricklets with new
versions. These new versions have a 
:ref:`co-processor instead of an EEPROM <tutorial_eeprom_vs_co_processor>`
and they have a different connector.

The old connector has 10 poles and is held in the connector header by
friction. Unfortunately it is possible to push this connector in at an
angle and bend pins in the header. This was the most common complained we
got about the building blocks, so we decided to use a new connector when
we did the switch from EEPROM to co-processor.

The new connector has 7 poles, it has a retaining hook and it can not be
pushed into the connector header at an angle.

As a result of these changes we are currently selling two different kinds of
cables for older modules. These are intended as spare parts or to be able to use
the remaining offered stock of older modules:

**Bricklet cable 7-pole - 10-pole (7p-10p)**

The 7p-10p cables can be used to connect older Bricks (10-pole) with new Bricklets with 7-pole connector.

Available cables:

* `Bricklet Cable 6cm (7p-10p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-black-6cm-7p-10p.html>`__
* `Bricklet Cable 15cm (7p-10p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-black-15cm-7p-10p.html>`__
* `Bricklet Cable 50cm (7p-10p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-black-50cm-7p-10p.html>`__
* `Bricklet Cable 100cm (7p-10p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-black-100cm-7p-10p.html>`__
* `Bricklet Cable 200cm (7p-10p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-black-200cm-7p-10p.html>`__

.. warning::

  Important! These cables are intended to connect a 10-pole Brick with a 7-pole Bricklet. It is not working the other way round!
  You will not be able to connect a 7-pole Brick with a 10-pole Bricklet with these cables!


**Bricklet Cable 10-pole - 10-pole (10p-10p)**

The 10p-10p cables can be used to connect old Bricks (10-pole) with old Bricklets (10-pole).
