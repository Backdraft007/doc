Tutorial - Bricklet Cables (7 pole vs 10 pole) 
==============================================

Early 2017 we started to replace all of the existing Bricklets with new
versions. These new versions have a 
:ref:`co-processor instead of an EEPROM <tutorial_eeprom_vs_co_processor>`
and they have a different connector.

The old connector has 10 poles and is held in the connector header by
friction. Unfortunately it is possible to push this connector in at an
angle and bend pins in the header. This was the most common complained we
got about the building blocks, so we decided to use a new connector when
we did the switch from EEPROM to co-processor.

The new connector has 7 poles, it has a retaining hook and it can not be
pushed into the connector header at an angle.

As a result of these changes we are now selling three different kinds of
cables:

* 10 pole - 10 pole (10p-10p),
* 7 pole - 10 pole (7p-10p) and
* 7 pole - 7 pole (7p-7p).

Old Bricklet with 10p connector and new Bricklet with 7p connector:

Below we will describe the different kinds of cables and their use cases. 


Bricklet Cable 10 pole - 10 pole (10p-10p)
------------------------------------------

The 10p-10p cables can be used to connect Bricks with 

* Old Bricklets with 10 pole connector. 

These Bricklets will be replaced by new Bricklets with 7 pole connectors
in the future. Thus the 10p-10p cable we become obsolete in the future.

Bricklet Cable 7 pole - 10 pole (7p-10p)
----------------------------------------

The 7p-10p cables can be used to connect Bricks with 

* New Bricklets with 7 pole connector.

Available cables:

* `Bricklet Cable 6cm (7p-10p) <https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/shop/accessories/bricklet-cable-black-6cm-7p-10p.html>`__

Bricklet Cable 7 pole - 7 pole (7p-7p)
--------------------------------------

The 7p-7p cables can be used to connect new Bricklets with 7 pole
connectors with

* :ref:`Isolator Bricklet <isolator_bricklet>`,
* Bricklet HAT (not yet released) and
* Bricklet HAT Zero (not yet released).

It is not possible to connect a old 10 pole Bricklet to the Isolator or a
HAT.

Below you can see a Isolator Bricklet connected to a Master Brick and
Voltage/Current Bricklet. In this configuration it needs a 7p-10p cable to
the left and a 7p-7p cable to the right.

Future Outlook
--------------

In the future all of the connector headers will be changed to the
new 7 pole type (including the Bricks) and the 7p-7p cable will be the 
only remaining cable type.

Please don't worry if you have old Bricklets with 10 pole connector. We will
keep compatible Bricks with 10 pole connector in the shop, so you will
always be able to use them.
