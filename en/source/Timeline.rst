Timeline
========

In the following you can find a proposed timeline of new hardware and new 
features. We intend to release something new  at least every two weeks. The 
list is not binding, we may release two things in two weeks and then nothing 
for the next two weeks and we may especially interchange items. For example 
if we need more prototypes as planned for some new hardware, we may release a 
software feature in this "release slot" that was planned for a later time.

Timeline
--------

We will update the timeline as soon as we have better estimates or a firm date.
