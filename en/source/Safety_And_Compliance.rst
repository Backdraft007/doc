----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Do not expose to water or high moisture.
* Do not place on a conductive surface.
* Do not hotplug Bricks in a stack or Bricklets to a Brick.
* Try to handle the circuit boards only at the edges to avoid electrical discharge directly to a component.
* Connecting incompatible devices to external ports (e.g. over-voltage on digital/analog inputs) may result in damage.
* External actuators, sensors or other peripherals that are connected need to comply with the relevant safety standards for the overall system to be safe.

Bricklets that can be used together with mains voltage
