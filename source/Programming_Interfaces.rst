High Level Programming Interface (HLPI)
---------------------------------------

* Preprogrammed
* controlled by PC
* pc connection direct over USB or master (stack) and extension
* bricklet features automatically added
* High Level Programming Tutorial
* Platforms: Windows, Linux, MacOS
* How things connected

Low Level Programming Interface (LLPI)
--------------------------------------

If you have an microcontroller board and want to use our products, 
the Low Level Programming Interface may hit the spot. You can
access every :ref:`Brick <product_overview_bricks>` over a **SPI**, **I2C** or **serial**
connection. :ref:`Bricklets <product_overview_bricklets>` can be accesses by these
interfaces over the connected Brick. 

Additionally it is possible to use our Bricklets as breakout boards
and read the equipped sensor directly (e.g. the analog voltage of an light
sensor).

.. note::

   | Currently only the direct access on Bricklets is supported.
   | See particular documentation for more information.

   Support of Bricks will coming soon...

On Device Programming Interface (ODPI)
--------------------------------------

On Device Programming Interface (ODPI) is an API to write your own firmware on our
devices.

.. note::

   Currently only the source-code of our devices is online (Todo Link). You are
   free to adapt the code for your own purposes. We are working on a
   special API to assist easy firmware development.

   Comming soon...
