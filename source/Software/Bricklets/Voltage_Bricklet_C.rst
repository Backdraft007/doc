API
---

Every function of the c bindings returns an integer which describes an
error code. Data returned from the device, when a getter is called,
is handled via call by reference. These parameters are labelled with the
``ret_`` prefix.

Possible error codes are

 * E_OK = 0
 * E_TIMEOUT = -1
 * E_NO_STREAM_SOCKET = -2
 * E_HOSTNAME_INVALID = -3
 * E_NO_CONNECT = -4
 * E_NO_THREAD = -5
 * E_NOT_ADDED = -6

as defined in :file:`ip_connection.h`.


Basic Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. c:function:: void voltage_create(Voltage *voltage, const char *uid)

 Creates a Voltage object with the unique device ID *uid*::

    Voltage voltage;
    voltage_create(&voltage, "YOUR_DEVICE_UID");

 This object can then be added to the IP connection (see examples 
 :ref:`above <voltage_bricklet_c_examples>`).


.. c:function:: int voltage_get_voltage(Voltage *voltage, uint16_t *ret_voltage)

 Returns the voltage of the sensor. The value is in mV and
 between 0mV and 50000mV.
 
 If you want to get the voltage periodically, it is recommended to use the
 callback :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_VOLTAGE` and set the period with 
 :c:func:`voltage_set_voltage_callback_period`.
 


Advanced Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. c:function:: int voltage_get_analog_value(Voltage *voltage, uint16_t *ret_value)

 Returns the value as read by a 12 bit analog to digital converter.
 The value is between 0 and 4095.
 
  .. note::
   The value returned by :c:func:`voltage_get_voltage` is averaged over several samples
   to yield less noise, while :c:func:`voltage_get_analog_value` gives back raw
   unfiltered analog values. The only reason to use :c:func:`voltage_get_analog_value` is,
   if you need the full resolution of the analog to digital converter.
 
 If you want the analog value periodically, it is recommended to use the 
 callback :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_ANALOG_VALUE` and set the period with 
 :c:func:`voltage_set_analog_value_callback_period`.
 


Callback Configuration Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. c:function:: void voltage_register_callback(Voltage *voltage, uint8_t cb_id, void *func)

 Registers a callback with ID *cb_id* to the function *func*. The available
 IDs with corresponding function signatures are listed 
 :ref:`below <voltage_bricklet_c_callbacks>`.


.. c:function:: int voltage_set_voltage_callback_period(Voltage *voltage, uint32_t period)

 Sets the period in ms with which the :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_VOLTAGE` callback is called 
 periodically. A value of 0 turns the callback off.
 
 :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_VOLTAGE` is only called if the voltage has changed since the
 last call.
 
 The default value is 0.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_get_voltage_callback_period(Voltage *voltage, uint32_t *ret_period)

 Returns the period as set by :c:func:`voltage_set_voltage_callback_period`.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_set_analog_value_callback_period(Voltage *voltage, uint32_t period)

 Sets the period in ms with which the :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_ANALOG_VALUE` callback is called 
 periodically. A value of 0 turns the callback off.
 
 :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_ANALOG_VALUE` is only called if the analog value has changed since the
 last call.
 
 The default value is 0.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_get_analog_value_callback_period(Voltage *voltage, uint32_t *ret_period)

 Returns the period as set by :c:func:`voltage_set_analog_value_callback_period`.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_set_voltage_callback_threshold(Voltage *voltage, char option, int16_t min, int16_t max)

 Sets the thresholds for the :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_VOLTAGE_REACHED` callback. 
 
 The following options are possible:
 
 .. csv-table::
  :header: "Option", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 100
 
  "'x'", "Callback is turned off."
  "'o'", "Callback is called when the voltage is *outside* the min and max values"
  "'i'", "Callback is called when the voltage is *inside* the min and max values"
  "'<'", "Callback is called when the voltage is smaller than the min value (max is ignored)"
  "'>'", "Callback is called when the voltage is greater than the min value (max is ignored)"
 
 The default value is ('x', 0, 0).
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_get_voltage_callback_threshold(Voltage *voltage, char *ret_option, int16_t *ret_min, int16_t *ret_max)

 Returns the threshold as set by :c:func:`voltage_set_voltage_callback_threshold`.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_set_analog_value_callback_threshold(Voltage *voltage, char option, uint16_t min, uint16_t max)

 Sets the thresholds for the :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_ANALOG_VALUE_REACHED` callback. 
 
 The following options are possible:
 
 .. csv-table::
  :header: "Option", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 100
 
  "'x'", "Callback is turned off."
  "'o'", "Callback is called when the voltage is *outside* the min and max values"
  "'i'", "Callback is called when the voltage is *inside* the min and max values"
  "'<'", "Callback is called when the voltage is smaller than the min value (max is ignored)"
  "'>'", "Callback is called when the voltage is greater than the min value (max is ignored)"
 
 The default value is ('x', 0, 0).
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_get_analog_value_callback_threshold(Voltage *voltage, char *ret_option, uint16_t *ret_min, uint16_t *ret_max)

 Returns the threshold as set by :c:func:`voltage_set_analog_value_callback_threshold`.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_set_debounce_period(Voltage *voltage, uint32_t debounce)

 Sets the period in ms with which the threshold callbacks
 
  :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_VOLTAGE_REACHED`, :c:data:`VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_ANALOG_VALUE_REACHED`
 
 are called, if the thresholds 
 
  :c:func:`voltage_set_voltage_callback_threshold`, :c:func:`voltage_set_analog_value_callback_threshold`
 
 keep beeing reached.
 
 The default value is 100.
 
.. c:function:: int voltage_get_debounce_period(Voltage *voltage, uint32_t *ret_debounce)

 Returns the debounce period as set by :c:func:`voltage_set_debounce_period`.
 


.. _voltage_bricklet_c_callbacks:

Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^

*Callbacks* can be registered with *callback IDs* to receive
time critical or recurring data from the device. The registration is done
with the ``register_callback`` function. The parameters consist of
the device object, the callback id and the callback function::

    void my_callback(int p) {
        printf("parameter: %d\n", p);
    }

    voltage_register_callback(&voltage, VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_EXAMPLE, (void*)my_callback);

The available constants with corresponding callback function signatures 
are described below.

 .. note::
  Using callbacks for recurring events is *always* prefered 
  compared to using getters. It will use less USB bandwith and the latency
  will be a lot better, since there is no roundtrip time.

.. c:var:: VOLTAGE_CALLBACK_VOLTAGE
