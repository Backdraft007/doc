Doc
===

This repository contains the sphinx documentation for all Bricks and
Bricklets.

Usage
-----
The documentation is partly auto generated, so you need to clone the
generators (https://github.com/Tinkerforge/generators) first and execute
the generator and copy scripts.

You can compile the html with "make html".
